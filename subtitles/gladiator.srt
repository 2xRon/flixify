1
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,859
- Sir.
- General.

2
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,236
- General.
- Sir.

3
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,489
General.

4
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,616
-Sir.
- General.

5
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,284
General.

6
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,953
- Sir.

7
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,388
Lean and hungry.

8
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,810
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

9
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,771
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

10
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:03,777
- Will they fight, sir?
- We shall know soon enough.

11
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,488
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

12
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:10,075
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

13
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,620
- The danger to the cavalry-
- It is acceptable. Agreed?

14
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,965
They say no.

15
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,518
- Steady! Steady!

16
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,743
People should know
when they're conquered.

17
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:07,758
Would you, Quintus?
Would l?

18
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,108
Strength and honor.

19
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,736
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

20
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,869
At my signal,
unleash hell.

21
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,978
Load the catapults.

22
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,481
Infantry form up
for advance.

23
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,942
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

24
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,819
- Knock!
- Knock!

25
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,804
- Patres!
- Maximus!

26
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,101
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

27
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:45,647
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

28
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,943
Hold the line!
Stay with me!

29
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,738
If you find yourself alone,

30
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,449
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

31
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,953
do not be troubled.

32
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:03,665
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

33
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,669
Brothers,

34
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:11,715
what we do in life...

35
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,759
echoes in eternity.

36
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:23,018
- Pull!

37
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,737
Pull! Pull!

38
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,702
Catapults ready, sir!

39
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,924
Archers, ignite!

40
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,593
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

41
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,060
Archers, draw!

42
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,773
Loose!

43
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,944
Loose!

44
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,161
Aah!

45
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,330
Aah!

46
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:33,296
- Aah!
- Aah!

47
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,013
All right, men, ready!

48
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,937
Hold the line!

49
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,237
Draw! Loose!

50
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,489
Loose! Loose!

51
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,491
Reload!

52
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,040
Hold the line!

53
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:10,417
Draw! Loose!

54
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,797
Stay with me!

55
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:22,429
Stay with me!

56
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:53,126
Roma Victor!

57
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,603
Aah!

58
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:23,490
Aah!

59
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,464
Aah!

60
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:47,264
Aah!

61
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,476
Aah!

62
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,454
Aah!

63
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,545
Aah!

64
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,157
Aah!

65
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,281
Roma Victor!

66
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,951
Do you think
he's really dying?

67
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,996
He's been dying
for ten years.

68
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,291
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

69
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,544
Maybe he just
misses us.

70
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:25,380
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if-

71
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,382
Peace, Commodus.

72
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:31,053
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

73
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,394
He's made
his decision.

74
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,897
He's going to announce it.

75
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,985
He will name me.

76
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,574
The first thing I shall do...

77
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,576
when-

78
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,040
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

79
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:04,544
For now, the first thing
I shall do is have a bath.

80
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:08,006
- Your Highness?

81
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,345
We seem to be almost there, sir.

82
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:22,062
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

83
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:25,273
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 1 9 days.

84
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,110
The wounded are
still coming in.

85
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,112
My horse.

86
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,114
My lord.

87
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,202
Kiss?

88
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,447
You have proved
your valor...

89
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,658
yet again, Maximus.

90
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,704
Let us hope
for the last time.

91
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,582
There's no one
left to fight, sire.

92
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:26,126
Ah. There is always
someone left to fight.

93
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,129
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

94
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,137
Let me go home.

95
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,890
Ah. Home.

96
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:48,315
Whoa! Whoa!

97
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,202
They honor you, Caesar.

98
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,205
It's for you, Maximus.
They honor you.

99
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:28,772
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

100
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,525
You have
missed the war.

101
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,944
Father, congratulations.

102
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,947
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph.

103
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,032
Save the bulls.

104
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,284
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.

105
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,371
- General.
- Highness.

106
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:48,750
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

107
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,086
It has been too long,
my old friend.

108
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,255
- Highness.
- Here, Father.

109
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,632
Take my arm.

110
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,720
I think it is time
for me to leave.

111
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:17,904
So much for
the glory of Rome.

112
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,635
Magnificent battle.

113
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,078
- General.
- Still alive?

114
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,164
-Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

115
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,917
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

116
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,544
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

117
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,714
Home. My wife,
the son, the harvest.

118
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,927
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

119
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,639
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

120
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,891
- Here he is.
- Highness.

121
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,851
Senator Gaius,
Senator Falco.

122
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:33,355
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed
potion in your ear...

123
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:36,191
and you'll wake up one day,
and all you'll say is,
" Republic, republic, republic."

124
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:39,361
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

125
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:42,280
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

126
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,783
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, of course.

127
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,536
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?

128
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:52,874
The soldier has the advantage
of being able to look
his enemy in the eye, Senator.

129
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,962
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

130
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,923
I warned you.
Now I shall save you. Senators.

131
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:12,060
Maximus.

132
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,980
I'm going to need
good men like you.

133
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,568
How may I be of service,
Highness?

134
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,529
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

135
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:26,074
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

136
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:30,787
But these senators scheme
and squabble and flatter and deceive.

137
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,332
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

138
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,961
Can I count on you...
when the time comes?

139
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:47,012
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

140
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:51,224
Home?
Well, no one's earned it more.

141
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:55,312
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

142
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:00,192
Lucilla's here.
Did you know?

143
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:03,153
She's not forgotten you.

144
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,489
And now you're
the great man.

145
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,545
If only you
had been born a man.

146
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,590
What a caesar
you would have made.

147
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,552
Father.

148
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,935
You would have
been strong.

149
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:38,105
I wonder,
would you have been just?

150
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:40,816
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

151
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,318
Oh.

152
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:45,320
How was your journey?

153
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:49,658
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

154
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,244
I need your help.
With your brother.

155
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,454
Of course.

156
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,456
He loves you.
He always has.

157
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,627
And...

158
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:04,131
he will need you now
more than ever.

159
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,762
Enough of politics.

160
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:15,183
Let us pretend that you
are a loving daughter...

161
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,269
and I am a good father.

162
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:26,111
This is a pleasant fiction,
isn't it?

163
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,375
Good morning.

164
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:55,599
I need three more horses.

165
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:07,611
Two! Three!

166
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:09,654
Four!

167
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,366
One! Two!

168
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,926
You sent for me, Caesar?

169
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:35,222
Caesar?

170
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:38,725
Tell me again, Maximus.

171
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,728
Why are we here?

172
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,731
For the glory
of the Empire, sire.

173
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:46,733
Ah, yes.

174
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:50,237
Ah, yes, I remember.

175
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:55,242
Do you see that map,
Maximus?

176
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:59,413
That is the world
which I created.

177
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:01,790
For25years...

178
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:06,670
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the Empire.

179
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:10,716
Since I became caesar,
I've known four years without war.

180
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,093
Four years of peace in 20.

181
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,929
And for what?

182
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:26,022
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

183
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,775
Caesar, your life-

184
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,945
Please.
Please don't call me that.

185
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,781
Come. Please.

186
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,034
Come sit.

187
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:40,328
Let us talk together now-

188
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,706
very simply-as men.

189
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:48,045
Maximus... talk.

190
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:54,551
Five thousand of my men
are out there in the freezing mud.

191
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,054
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

192
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,222
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

193
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,767
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

194
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,769
And what would you
believe, Maximus?

195
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,064
They fought for you...
and for Rome.

196
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:10,025
And what is Rome,
Maximus?

197
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:13,570
I've seen much of
the rest of the world.

198
00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:17,574
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

199
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,701
Yet you have
never been there.

200
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:22,204
You have not seen
what it has become.

201
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:25,332
I am dying, Maximus.

202
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,334
When a man sees his end,

203
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,921
he wants to know there was
some purpose this life.

204
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:34,633
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

205
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,052
Will I be known
as the philosopher?

206
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:40,389
The warrior?
The tyrant?

207
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:46,478
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

208
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,648
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

209
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,776
You could only
whisper it.

210
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,862
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish.

211
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,115
It was so fragile.

212
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:01,868
And I fear that it will not
survive the winter.

213
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,706
Maximus,

214
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,709
Let us whisper now,

215
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,044
together, you and l.

216
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,797
You have a son.

217
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,633
Tell me about your home.

218
00:25:22,597 --> 00:25:27,477
My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.
A very simple place.

219
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,940
Pinkstones
that warm in the sun.

220
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:36,028
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

221
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:38,030
jasmine in the evening.

222
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,617
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

223
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,537
Figs, apples, pears.

224
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,539
The soil, Marcus-
black.

225
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,459
- Black like my wife's hair.

226
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,794
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

227
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:55,464
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

228
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:58,383
- He wants to be one of them.
- Remember the last time you were home?

229
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:01,845
Two years, 264 days,
and this morning.

230
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:05,682
I envy you, Maximus.

231
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:09,478
It's a good home.
Worth fighting for.

232
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:15,525
There is one more duty...

233
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,862
that I ask of you
before you go home.

234
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,491
What would you
have me do, Caesar?

235
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:25,994
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

236
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:30,374
I will empower you
to one end alone.

237
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:34,711
To give power back
to the people of Rome...

238
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:37,923
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

239
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:47,432
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

240
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,229
With all my heart, no.

241
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,816
Maximus,

242
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:58,819
that is why
it must be you.

243
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,821
But surely a prefect,
a senator,

244
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:03,740
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

245
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,785
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

246
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:16,086
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

247
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,422
You have known that
since you were young.

248
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,091
Commodus cannot rule.

249
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:23,427
He must not rule.

250
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:27,514
You are the son
that I should have had.

251
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:33,687
Commodus will accept
my decision.

252
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:40,235
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

253
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,950
I- I need
some time, sire.

254
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,952
Yes.

255
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:53,040
By sunset,
I hope you will have agreed.

256
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:56,084
Now embrace me as my son.

257
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:01,506
And bring an old man
another blanket.

258
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,649
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

259
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,069
It was not always so.

260
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:24,363
Many things change.

261
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,240
Many things.
Not everything.

262
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,995
Maximus, stop.

263
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:38,335
Let me see your face.

264
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:41,171
Hmm. You seem upset.

265
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,382
I lost many men.

266
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,301
What did my father
want with you?

267
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:49,888
To wish me well
before I leave for home.

268
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:52,015
You're lying.

269
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:55,602
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

270
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:58,188
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

271
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:00,857
But then you never had to.

272
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,652
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

273
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:08,740
Or do you
think me heartless?

274
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:11,785
I think you have
a talent for survival.

275
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,544
Maximus, stop.

276
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:23,463
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

277
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:27,259
No. I'm tired
from battle.

278
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:30,137
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

279
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:36,935
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

280
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:42,315
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

281
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,903
I will always serve Rome.

282
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:50,365
Do you know,

283
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,909
I still remember you
in my prayers.

284
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:57,873
Oh, yes. I pray.

285
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:04,379
I was sad to hear
of your husband's death. I mourned him.

286
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,426
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

287
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:14,556
Yes. Lucius.

288
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,892
He'll be nearly
eight years old.

289
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:19,519
My son is also
nearly eight.

290
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:24,274
I thank you
for your prayers.

291
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:36,036
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

292
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,624
Blessed mother, come tome
with the gods' desire for my future.

293
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:44,503
Blessed father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

294
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:50,133
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

295
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:53,553
Ancestors, I honor you...

296
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:57,057
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.

297
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:20,872
Cicero.

298
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:27,087
Sir.

299
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,051
You don't find it hard
to do your duty?

300
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,725
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

301
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,561
The rest of the time
I do what I have to.

302
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:48,275
We may not be able
to go home after all.

303
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:21,058
Are you ready to do
your duty for Rome?

304
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:26,355
Yes, Father.

305
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:28,357
You will not be emperor.

306
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:34,112
Which wiser,
older man is to take my place?

307
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:37,491
My powers
will pass to Maximus...

308
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:39,826
to hold
in trust...

309
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,456
until the Senate
is ready to rule once more.

310
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:49,294
Rome is to be
a republic again.

311
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:53,715
- Maximus.
- Yes.

312
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:01,264
My decision
disappoints you?

313
00:33:05,102 --> 00:33:08,939
You wrote to me once,

314
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,859
Listing the four chief virtues.

315
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:16,113
Wisdom, justice,

316
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:19,491
fortitude and temperance.

317
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:25,997
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

318
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:29,626
But I have other virtues, Father.

319
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,295
Ambition.

320
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,340
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

321
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:40,053
Resourcefulness.
Courage.

322
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:43,348
Perhaps not on
the battlefield, but...

323
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,685
there are many forms of courage.

324
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:50,022
Devotion-
to my family...

325
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:52,649
and to you.

326
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,362
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

327
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:01,783
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

328
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,369
Oh, Commodus.

329
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:07,164
You go too far.

330
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:10,834
I search the faces
of the gods...

331
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:15,672
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

332
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:18,091
One kind word,

333
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,510
one full hug...

334
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:25,432
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight,

335
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:28,477
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years.

336
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:34,816
- What is it in me you hate so much?
- Shah, Commodus.

337
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,945
All I've ever wanted...

338
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:43,533
was to live up to you,
Caesar.

339
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,536
Father.

340
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,206
Commodus.

341
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:54,669
Your faults as a son...

342
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:58,673
is my failure as a father.

343
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:11,478
Come.

344
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:16,316
Father.

345
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:33,792
I would butcher
the whole world...

346
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,586
if you would
only love me!

347
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:17,794
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

348
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:26,803
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.

349
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,958
How did he die?

350
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,711
The surgeons say there was no pain.

351
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,880
His breath gave out
as he slept.

352
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:12,974
Father.

353
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,979
Your emperor asks
for your loyalty, Maximus.

354
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:22,067
Take my hand.

355
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:26,738
I only offer it once.

356
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:41,920
Quintus.

357
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:33,805
Hail, Caesar.

358
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:36,641
I must go to the senators.
I need their counsel.

359
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:39,269
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

360
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:41,563
- Sword.
- Sword.

361
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,568
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

362
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:50,030
Prudent?
The Emperor has been slain.

363
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:53,325
The Emperor died of natural causes.

364
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:56,411
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

365
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,875
Please don't fight,
Maximus.

366
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,213
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

367
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:10,842
Ride until dawn...
and then execute him.

368
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:13,345
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!

369
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:16,515
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

370
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:20,268
Your family will meet you
in the afterlife.

371
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:21,603
- No!

372
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:48,171
Kneel.

373
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:53,301
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

374
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,470
- Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.

375
00:39:58,056 --> 00:40:00,559
At least give me
a clean death.

376
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:02,604
A soldier's death.

377
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:27,420
The frost, sometimes it makes
the blade stick.

378
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:49,943
Praetorian!

379
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:53,780
Hyah! Hyah!

380
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:11,316
Remember the last time you were home?

381
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:15,946
Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

382
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:20,367
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

383
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,787
Whisper to them I live only
to hold them again.

384
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,207
For all else is dust and air,
and I live only to hold them again.

385
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:31,545
For all else is dust and air.

386
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:11,960
- Mama, isoldati!

387
00:43:30,604 --> 00:43:32,814
- Papa! Papa!

388
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:40,655
Hyah! Hyah!

389
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:20,315
- Don't die.

390
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:27,405
- You'll meet them again.

391
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,700
- Not yet.

392
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:42,879
No! They will clean it.
Wait and see.

393
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,748
Don't die.

394
00:47:18,832 --> 00:47:21,167
They'll feed you
to the lions.

395
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,211
They are worth more
than we are.

396
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,974
Better now?

397
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:38,018
Clean. You see?

398
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:10,592
Proximo!

399
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:13,178
My old friend.

400
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:16,515
Every day is a great day
when you are here.

401
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:21,228
Today...
is your most fortunate day.

402
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:26,066
Those giraffes
you sold me...

403
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:28,109
they won't mate.

404
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:32,781
They just walk around
eating and not mating.

405
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:36,243
You sold me...
queer giraffes.

406
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:40,664
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

407
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:46,378
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

408
00:48:48,171 --> 00:48:50,799
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

409
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:07,732
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

410
00:49:07,774 --> 00:49:10,485
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

411
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:12,571
You need both, I think.

412
00:49:12,654 --> 00:49:14,614
Get up!

413
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:25,917
- What's your trade?
- I was a hunter.

414
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:29,921
Oh, no. I bought him
from a salt mine in Carthage.

415
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:32,257
Sit down!

416
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:38,263
Mark of the legion.

417
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:41,433
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

418
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:43,602
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six...

419
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:45,645
- for 1 ,000.
- 1,000?

420
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:47,898
The Numidian alone
is worth 2,000!

421
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,650
These slaves
are rotten.

422
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,944
It all adds to the flavor.
No. No, no, no. Wait-Wait.

423
00:49:53,028 --> 00:49:56,948
Wait! Can negotiate.

424
00:49:57,032 --> 00:50:01,494
I'll give you 2,000...
and four for the beasts.

425
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:05,081
That's 5,000
for an old friend.

426
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,725
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

427
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,603
I am Proximo!

428
00:50:26,686 --> 00:50:29,689
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

429
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:33,318
which will be last of your miserable
lives, than that bitch of a mother...

430
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:36,321
- that brought you screaming
into this world!

431
00:50:36,404 --> 00:50:40,283
I did not pay good money
for you for your company!

432
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:45,705
- I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

433
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:49,543
And as your mother
was there at your beginning,

434
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,921
so I shall be there
at your end.

435
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:57,676
- And when you die, and die you shall,

436
00:50:57,759 --> 00:51:00,720
your transition shall be
to the sound of-

437
00:51:05,851 --> 00:51:09,521
Gladiators, I salute you.

438
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,570
-Red!
-Red.

439
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:20,907
- Yellow!

440
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:23,410
Yellow.

441
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:33,044
Hyah!

442
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:35,422
Good.

443
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:36,965
- Red.
- Red!

444
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,597
Spaniard!

445
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:11,082
- Uhh.

446
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:19,257
That's enough
for the moment!

447
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:21,843
His time will come.

448
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:25,138
Next!

449
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,697
Spaniard, why don't you fight?

450
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,367
We all have to fight.

451
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:00,799
Is that the sign
of your gods?

452
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:09,057
Will that not anger them?

453
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:31,705
The gods favor you.

454
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,749
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,169
You will need
their help today.

456
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:58,523
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight.

457
00:53:58,607 --> 00:54:00,942
Some that you can't fight.

458
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:06,406
They all say that,
until they're out there.

459
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:11,369
- Listen.
-Kill. Kill. Kill.

460
00:54:11,411 --> 00:54:13,914
Kill. Kill. Kill.

461
00:54:19,586 --> 00:54:22,047
Thrust this
into another man's flesh,

462
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,008
and then they will applaud
and love you for that.

463
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:28,345
You-

464
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:30,764
You may begin
to love them...

465
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:33,642
for that.

466
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,191
Ultimately,
we're all dead men.

467
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,696
Sadly, we cannot
choose how, but...

468
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,367
we can decide how
we meet that end...

469
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,329
in order that
we are remembered...

470
00:54:54,412 --> 00:54:56,373
as men.

471
00:55:00,752 --> 00:55:03,505
On the left,
draw your shields!

472
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:06,591
On the right,
draw your swords!

473
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:08,635
-Kill. Kill-

474
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:13,849
Pair them up-
red with yellow.

475
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:18,311
Next!

476
00:55:21,815 --> 00:55:23,233
Next!

477
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:19,516
- Hyah! Hyah!

478
00:59:06,706 --> 00:59:09,376
- Go away!

479
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:42,659
He enters Rome
like a conquering hero.

480
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:44,703
But what
has he conquered?

481
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:47,789
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

482
00:59:47,873 --> 00:59:49,833
I think he could do very well.

483
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,835
For Rome or for you?

484
00:59:57,924 --> 01:00:00,677
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

485
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:11,021
- Lucius!
- Mother!

486
01:00:12,063 --> 01:00:16,193
- Hail, Caesar.
- Senators.

487
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:21,865
Rome greets
her new emperor.

488
01:00:21,907 --> 01:00:25,410
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

489
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:28,914
Thank you, Falco.
And for the loyal subjects,

490
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:32,459
- I trust they weren't too expensive.
- Caesar.

491
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:36,630
- Gracchus.
- All Rome rejoices
in your return, Caesar.

492
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:38,882
There are many matters
that require your attention.

493
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:45,388
- To order! To order!

494
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:50,185
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

495
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:53,688
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city.

496
01:00:53,772 --> 01:00:57,943
Beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter...

497
01:00:58,026 --> 01:01:01,154
to combat the plague which is already
springing up there.

498
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,658
- So, if Caesar-
- Shah.

499
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:08,870
Don't you see, Gracchus?

500
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:11,164
That's the very problem,
isn't it?

501
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:14,334
My father spent
all his time at study...

502
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:19,965
of books and learning
and philosophy.

503
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:25,095
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

504
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:28,515
And all the while,
the people have forgotten-

505
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:31,017
But the Senate
is the People, sire.

506
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:34,813
Chosen from among the people...
to speak for the people.

507
01:01:34,896 --> 01:01:39,484
I doubt that many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

508
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:44,739
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.

509
01:01:44,823 --> 01:01:48,535
Then, perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us...

510
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:50,871
out of his own
extensive experience.

511
01:01:54,749 --> 01:01:56,751
- I call it love.

512
01:01:56,793 --> 01:02:00,714
- I am their father.
The people are my children.

513
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:03,008
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

514
01:02:03,091 --> 01:02:05,552
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

515
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:18,064
No, but if you interrupt me again,
I assure you that you shall.

516
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:21,109
Senator, my brother
is very tired.

517
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:23,737
Leave your list with me.

518
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,489
Caesar shall do
all that Rome requires.

519
01:02:26,573 --> 01:02:31,453
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

520
01:02:38,418 --> 01:02:41,004
Who are they
to lecture me?

521
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,673
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

522
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:46,510
What uses?
All they do is talk.

523
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,972
It should be just...
you and me...

524
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:53,600
- and Rome.
- Don't even think it!

525
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:56,102
There's always
been a Senate.

526
01:02:56,186 --> 01:03:00,482
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor...

527
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:03,401
-to rule an empire.
-Of course, but leave the people their-

528
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:06,071
Illusions.

529
01:03:06,154 --> 01:03:08,406
Traditions.

530
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,743
My father's war
against the barbarians-

531
01:03:11,826 --> 01:03:14,538
He said it himself,
it achieved nothing.

532
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:17,749
- But the people loved him.
- The people always love victories.

533
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:22,712
Why? They didn't see the battles.

534
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:26,758
- What do they care about Germania?
- They care about the greatness of Rome.

535
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,720
The greatness of Rome.

536
01:03:30,804 --> 01:03:33,515
Well, what is that?

537
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:39,354
It's an idea-
greatness.

538
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,653
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

539
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:51,408
Do you not see, Lucilla?

540
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:56,121
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

541
01:03:56,204 --> 01:04:00,750
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry, old men.

542
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:15,557
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

543
01:05:05,357 --> 01:05:09,402
Vino, vino, vino!
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

544
01:05:11,696 --> 01:05:17,536
Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine
for your drinking pleasure!

545
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:19,538
Games.

546
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:24,251
1 50 days of games.

547
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:27,963
- He's cleverer than I thought.
- Oh, clever.

548
01:05:28,046 --> 01:05:30,715
The whole of Rome would
be laughing at him...

549
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,385
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

550
01:05:33,468 --> 01:05:36,930
Fear and wonder-
a powerful combination.

551
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,850
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

552
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:44,229
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

553
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:47,607
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

554
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:51,736
Take away their freedom
and still they'll roar.

555
01:05:51,778 --> 01:05:54,364
The beating heart
of Rome...

556
01:05:54,447 --> 01:05:56,658
is not the marble
of the Senate.

557
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,119
It's the sand
of the Colosseum.

558
01:06:00,203 --> 01:06:02,497
He'll bring them death,

559
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:06,877
and they will
love him for it.

560
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:15,635
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

561
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:30,358
Spaniard.

562
01:06:30,442 --> 01:06:32,861
- Spain.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

563
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:36,072
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

564
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:39,701
Guard!

565
01:07:42,848 --> 01:07:45,642
- Are you not entertained?

566
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:47,978
Are you not entertained?

567
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:53,233
Is this not why you are here?

568
01:07:57,737 --> 01:08:01,241
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

569
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:05,620
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

570
01:08:08,248 --> 01:08:10,625
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

571
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:14,713
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

572
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:19,926
What do you want?

573
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,012
Huh?

574
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:24,014
Girl?

575
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,016
Boy?

576
01:08:26,099 --> 01:08:29,227
- You sent for me?
- Yes, I did.

577
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,480
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

578
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:36,193
- You could be magnificent.
- I'm required to kill, so I kill.

579
01:08:36,276 --> 01:08:38,195
That is enough.

580
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:41,656
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

581
01:08:44,117 --> 01:08:46,411
- The young emperor...

582
01:08:46,494 --> 01:08:49,456
has arranged
a series of spectacles...

583
01:08:49,497 --> 01:08:53,919
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

584
01:08:54,002 --> 01:08:55,962
I find that amusing...

585
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:58,006
since it was Marcus Aurelius-

586
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:00,842
the wise, the all-knowing
Marcus Aurelius-

587
01:09:00,884 --> 01:09:03,136
- that closed us down.

588
01:09:05,722 --> 01:09:09,684
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living...

589
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,354
in flea-infested
villages,

590
01:09:12,395 --> 01:09:15,732
we're finally going back
to where we belong-

591
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:17,901
the Colosseum.

592
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:22,405
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

593
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:27,035
Fifty-thousand Romans...

594
01:09:27,077 --> 01:09:31,081
watching...
every movement of your sword,

595
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:34,501
willing you to make
that killer blow.

596
01:09:35,752 --> 01:09:38,296
The silence before you strike...

597
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,423
and the noise afterwards,

598
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:43,510
it rises-
it rises up like-

599
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:47,681
Like th-
Like- Like a storm...

600
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:49,766
as if you were
the thunder god himself.

601
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,895
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

602
01:10:00,026 --> 01:10:01,987
You won your freedom?

603
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:05,657
A long time ago,
the emperor...

604
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,243
presented me
with a rudius.

605
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:11,162
It's just a wooden sword.

606
01:10:12,706 --> 01:10:16,835
The symbol of your freedom.
He-

607
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:21,506
- He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

608
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:25,385
- You knew Marcus Aurelius?
- I did not say I knew him.

609
01:10:25,427 --> 01:10:27,637
I said he touched me
on the shoulder once.

610
01:10:29,014 --> 01:10:32,392
You asked me what I want.

611
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:35,020
I, too, want to stand
in front of the emperor...

612
01:10:36,313 --> 01:10:38,231
as you did.

613
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:42,152
Then, listen to me.
Learn from me.

614
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:46,406
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

615
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:50,076
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

616
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:55,248
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

617
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:00,378
I will win the crowd.

618
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:06,593
- I will give them something
they have never seen before.
- Ha!

619
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:10,347
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

620
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:12,432
and have bloody adventures!

621
01:11:12,516 --> 01:11:14,601
And the great whore
will suckle us until we are...

622
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:16,811
fat and happy and
can suckle no more.

623
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:19,397
And then,

624
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:23,235
when enough men have died,

625
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:25,278
perhaps you will
have your freedom.

626
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:33,578
Here. Use this.

627
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,811
It's somewhere out there-

628
01:11:57,894 --> 01:12:02,732
my country, my home.

629
01:12:02,774 --> 01:12:06,570
My wife is preparing food.

630
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:10,073
My daughters carry
water from the river.

631
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:12,450
Will I ever
see them again?

632
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:14,578
I think no.

633
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:17,622
Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?

634
01:12:17,706 --> 01:12:20,208
I think so.

635
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:24,671
But then, I will die soon.

636
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:26,673
They will not die
for many years.

637
01:12:28,383 --> 01:12:32,429
- I'll have to wait.
- But you would... wait.

638
01:12:32,512 --> 01:12:36,141
Of course.

639
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:38,643
You see,

640
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:43,523
my wife...
and my son...

641
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,525
are already
waiting for me.

642
01:12:45,609 --> 01:12:48,111
You'll meet them again.

643
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:51,364
But not yet.

644
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:57,454
Not yet. Unless-

645
01:12:57,537 --> 01:12:59,456
Not yet.

646
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:05,003
Not yet.

647
01:14:07,232 --> 01:14:09,860
Out!

648
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:12,112
Go, go. Out!

649
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:26,376
Good to see you again,
old friend.

650
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:33,633
Bring me fortune.

651
01:14:38,388 --> 01:14:41,600
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

652
01:14:41,641 --> 01:14:45,729
- I didn't know men
could build such things.

653
01:14:54,946 --> 01:14:56,865
Win the crowd.

654
01:14:56,948 --> 01:15:00,577
Get Inside! Move. Inside.

655
01:15:49,918 --> 01:15:53,004
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

656
01:15:55,465 --> 01:15:59,594
Come, brother.
It's late.

657
01:16:01,221 --> 01:16:04,182
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

658
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:09,604
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

659
01:16:09,688 --> 01:16:14,484
All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.

660
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:23,577
Commodus,
drink this tonic.

661
01:16:32,794 --> 01:16:36,423
I think the time
is almost right.

662
01:16:36,506 --> 01:16:38,633
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

663
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:40,635
at the celebration
to honor our father.

664
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,847
You think I should?

665
01:16:43,889 --> 01:16:45,891
Are the people ready?

666
01:16:47,475 --> 01:16:49,436
I think you need
your rest now.

667
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:59,779
- Will you stay with me?
- Still afraid of the dark, brother?

668
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:13,126
Still. Always.

669
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:16,129
- Stay with me tonight?
- You know I won't.

670
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:22,052
Then, kiss me.

671
01:17:31,144 --> 01:17:33,855
Sleep, brother.

672
01:17:51,373 --> 01:17:53,750
Come on now.
Get out of the way!

673
01:17:58,547 --> 01:18:01,383
I want you. I want you.
I want you so-

674
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:03,718
All right, Let him pass!

675
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:22,279
-Sixty!

676
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:25,907
-500!

677
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:29,119
The emperor wants battles, and I don't
want to sacrifice my best fighters.

678
01:18:29,202 --> 01:18:32,747
The crowd wants battles,
so the emperor gives them battles.

679
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,083
And you get
the battle of Carthage.

680
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:38,628
The massacre of Carthage.
Guten tag.

681
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:41,923
Oh, why don't you go down
to the prison and round up
all the beggars and thieves.

682
01:18:41,965 --> 01:18:43,925
We've done that.

683
01:18:44,009 --> 01:18:46,887
If you want to give away
the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire,

684
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,431
I want double the rates.

685
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:52,976
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

686
01:18:53,059 --> 01:18:55,020
You don't like it?

687
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:59,024
Then you can crawl back down
that shithole that you came from.

688
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:03,612
-Cassius, please! Please, Cassius!

689
01:19:33,892 --> 01:19:36,520
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

690
01:19:36,603 --> 01:19:40,607
- Yes.
- They said you were a giant.

691
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,860
They said you could
crush a man's skull with one hand.

692
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:47,197
A man's? No.

693
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,075
A boy's.

694
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:55,080
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

695
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:59,543
This is Argento,
and this is Scarto.

696
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:02,671
They were my horses.

697
01:20:02,754 --> 01:20:07,342
- They were taken from me.
- I like you, Spaniard.

698
01:20:07,425 --> 01:20:09,928
- I shall cheer for you.
- They let you watch the games?

699
01:20:10,011 --> 01:20:13,640
- My uncle says it makes me strong.
- And what does your father say?

700
01:20:13,723 --> 01:20:15,684
My father's dead.

701
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:20,814
Master Lucius, it is time.

702
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:24,526
- I have to go.
- Your name is Lucius?

703
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:28,613
Lucius Verus,
after my father.

704
01:20:58,727 --> 01:21:00,896
Lower!

705
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:09,738
-Claudius! More shields!
- Yes, sir.

706
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,844
When the emperor enters,

707
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:37,098
raise your weapons,
salute him and then speak together!

708
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:42,395
Face the emperor and don't
turn your back on him!

709
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,274
Go, and die with honor!

710
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:43,456
Hail, mighty Caesar!

711
01:22:43,498 --> 01:22:47,460
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

712
01:22:47,544 --> 01:22:50,046
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

713
01:22:53,466 --> 01:22:56,136
And we who are about to die, salute you!

714
01:22:57,345 --> 01:23:00,390
On this day,

715
01:23:00,473 --> 01:23:04,352
we reach back
to hallowed antiquity...

716
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:07,814
to bring you a recreation
of the second fall...

717
01:23:07,898 --> 01:23:09,941
of mighty Carthage!

718
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:18,867
On the barren
plain of Zama,

719
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:22,329
there stood
the invincible armies...

720
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:25,582
of the barbarian, Hannibal.

721
01:23:25,624 --> 01:23:28,752
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors...

722
01:23:28,793 --> 01:23:31,463
from all brute nations...

723
01:23:31,546 --> 01:23:34,716
bent on merciless...

724
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:38,512
destruction, conquest.

725
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:42,641
Your emperor
is pleased to give you...

726
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:45,477
the barbarian horde!

727
01:23:54,361 --> 01:23:57,614
- Anyone here been in the army?
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:23:57,697 --> 01:23:59,741
I served
with you at Vindobona.

729
01:23:59,824 --> 01:24:02,702
You can help me.

730
01:24:02,786 --> 01:24:06,456
Whatever comes
out of these gates,

731
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,334
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

732
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:12,838
Do you understand?

733
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,675
If we stay together,
we survive.

734
01:24:16,716 --> 01:24:19,344
I'm pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

735
01:24:19,386 --> 01:24:24,057
of Scipio Africanus!

736
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:37,070
To the death!

737
01:24:39,322 --> 01:24:44,244
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

738
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:47,706
Stay close!

739
01:24:53,503 --> 01:24:55,755
Come together!

740
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:58,383
- Staggered columns!

741
01:24:58,466 --> 01:25:00,677
Staggered columns!

742
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:14,566
Soon all your men
will be slain.

743
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:16,568
You don't have a chance!

744
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:29,164
Lock your shields! Stay as one!

745
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:31,208
As one! As one!

746
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:32,876
Hold!

747
01:25:35,003 --> 01:25:36,588
Hold!

748
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:38,757
- As one!
- As one!

749
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:42,802
Well done!

750
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:48,183
Hyah! Hyah!

751
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:55,899
Hold!

752
01:25:55,982 --> 01:25:58,944
Diamond! Diamond!

753
01:26:03,615 --> 01:26:05,450
- Yes!

754
01:26:17,254 --> 01:26:19,130
- Haken!

755
01:26:42,612 --> 01:26:44,990
This column to the chariots!
This column...

756
01:26:45,031 --> 01:26:46,867
-stay with me!

757
01:26:49,786 --> 01:26:51,538
Quickly!

758
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:54,374
- Get out there!
- Hurry!

759
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:37,876
Maximus!

760
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:42,255
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.

761
01:27:48,345 --> 01:27:51,264
Single column!
Single column!

762
01:27:51,348 --> 01:27:52,974
Single column! Single column!

763
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:39,604
- We win!

764
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:46,945
My history's
a little hazy, Cassius.

765
01:28:46,987 --> 01:28:49,906
But shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

766
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:52,325
Uh, yes, sire.

767
01:28:52,367 --> 01:28:54,661
Um, forgive me, sire.

768
01:28:54,703 --> 01:28:58,415
No, I rather
enjoy surprises.

769
01:28:58,498 --> 01:29:03,712
- Who is he?
- They call him the Spaniard, sire.

770
01:29:05,255 --> 01:29:09,676
- I think I'll meet him.
- Yes, sire.

771
01:29:09,759 --> 01:29:13,763
Hail to the barbarians!

772
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:32,532
Forward! Arms at ready!

773
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:46,713
Drop your weapons!

774
01:29:48,965 --> 01:29:53,595
Gladiator, the emperor
has asked for you.

775
01:29:53,637 --> 01:29:55,639
I'm at the emperor's service.

776
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:26,753
Rise. Rise.

777
01:30:34,386 --> 01:30:36,596
Your fame is well deserved,
Spaniard.

778
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,683
I don't think there's ever
been a gladiator to match you.

779
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:42,269
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

780
01:30:42,352 --> 01:30:44,938
Or was it Hercules?

781
01:30:45,021 --> 01:30:48,859
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

782
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:55,699
- You do have a name?
- My name is Gladiator.

783
01:30:58,618 --> 01:31:01,121
- How dare you show your back to me?

784
01:31:01,204 --> 01:31:03,623
Slave!

785
01:31:03,707 --> 01:31:05,750
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

786
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,599
My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

787
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,018
commander of the armies
of the north,

788
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,854
general of the Felix Legions,

789
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:30,358
Loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

790
01:31:30,442 --> 01:31:32,903
father to a murdered son,

791
01:31:32,986 --> 01:31:35,780
husband to a murdered wife...

792
01:31:35,864 --> 01:31:39,451
and I will have my vengeance...
in this life or the next.

793
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:49,169
Arms!

794
01:32:00,305 --> 01:32:04,809
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

795
01:32:04,893 --> 01:32:10,565
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

796
01:32:12,651 --> 01:32:15,320
Live! Live! Live!

797
01:32:15,403 --> 01:32:18,907
Live! Live!
Live! Live!

798
01:32:51,606 --> 01:32:55,151
Guards, at rest!

799
01:33:44,367 --> 01:33:48,997
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

800
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,292
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

801
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:55,378
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

802
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:18,902
Why is he still alive?

803
01:34:18,985 --> 01:34:21,112
I don't know.

804
01:34:21,196 --> 01:34:23,448
He shouldn't be alive.

805
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:26,368
It vexes me.

806
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:29,371
I'm terribly vexed.

807
01:34:39,339 --> 01:34:41,258
I did what I had to do.

808
01:34:41,341 --> 01:34:46,221
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

809
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:48,515
You do see that?

810
01:34:48,598 --> 01:34:50,517
Yes.

811
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:57,649
What did you feel...
when you saw him?

812
01:34:59,901 --> 01:35:02,779
I felt nothing.

813
01:35:02,821 --> 01:35:05,824
He wounded you deeply,
didn't he?

814
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:10,328
No more than
I wounded him.

815
01:35:13,832 --> 01:35:16,168
They lied to me in Germania.

816
01:35:17,419 --> 01:35:20,255
They told me he was dead.

817
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:24,467
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

818
01:35:24,509 --> 01:35:27,220
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

819
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:31,808
Then you must
let the legions know...

820
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:35,437
their treachery
will not go unpunished.

821
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,900
Poor sister, I wouldn't
want to be your enemy.

822
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:43,361
What will you do?

823
01:35:54,581 --> 01:35:56,500
This way!

824
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:34,080
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured
by the bravest champions.

825
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:37,167
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

826
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,961
I didn't realize
he would send his best.

827
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:44,382
Maximus,
he doesn't know.

828
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:47,385
My family was burned and crucified
while they were still alive.

829
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:50,388
- I knew nothing-
- Don't lie to me!

830
01:36:56,936 --> 01:37:00,190
- I wept for them.
- As you wept for your father?

831
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,942
As you wept for
your father?

832
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:06,696
I have been living in
a prison of fear since that day.

833
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:11,409
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

834
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:14,412
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

835
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:16,748
because your son
is heir to the throne.

836
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,045
Oh, I have wept.

837
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:25,298
My son was innocent.

838
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:28,051
So is mine.

839
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,472
Must my son die, too,
before you will trust me?

840
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:38,311
What does it matter
if I trust you or not?

841
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:41,272
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

842
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:44,818
Today I saw a slave become
more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

843
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:46,945
The gods
have spared me?

844
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:50,407
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob!

845
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:53,660
That is power.
The mob is Rome.

846
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:56,454
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

847
01:37:57,747 --> 01:37:59,708
Listen to me.

848
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,003
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the senate.

849
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,505
But while
the people follow him,

850
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:08,675
no one would dare
stand up to him until you.

851
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:11,761
They oppose him,
yet they do nothing.

852
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:15,557
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

853
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:18,309
One man above all.

854
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:21,604
If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?

855
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:23,940
Do you not understand?

856
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:28,236
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

857
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,739
What possible
difference can I make?

858
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,408
This man wants
what you want.

859
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,453
Then have him
kill Commodus!

860
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:41,082
I knew a man once,

861
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:44,502
a noble man,
a man of principle...

862
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:47,297
who loved
my father.

863
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,175
And my father
loved him.

864
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:53,887
This man
served Rome well.

865
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,060
That man is gone.

866
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,395
Your brother
did his work well.

867
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,898
Let me help you.

868
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:14,157
Yes, you can help me.

869
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,953
Forget you ever knew me...

870
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:21,122
and never
come here again.

871
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:27,629
Guard! The lady has finished with me.

872
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,158
Maximus?

873
01:39:57,242 --> 01:40:00,912
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

874
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:03,957
- Yes.
- In Germania?

875
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:08,294
In many countries.

876
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:11,965
General.

877
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:02,015
You have a great name.

878
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:05,060
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

879
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:16,446
Yes, at the far end.

880
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:18,948
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

881
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,950
Senator Gracchus.

882
01:41:22,494 --> 01:41:25,872
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

883
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:28,541
I don't pretend to be a man
of the people, Senator.

884
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:31,711
But I do try to be a man
for the people.

885
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:49,354
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

886
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,398
Caesar! Caesar!

887
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,193
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

888
01:41:57,404 --> 01:41:59,656
People of Rome!

889
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:04,577
On the fourth day
of Antioch,

890
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:08,581
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

891
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:14,671
And, in his
majestic charity,

892
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:19,384
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...

893
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:23,638
with an historical
final match.

894
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,974
Returning to the Colosseum today...

895
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:30,520
after five years
in retirement, Caesar...

896
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:34,482
is pleased to bring you
the only...

897
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:36,818
undefeated champion...

898
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,320
- Yah! Yah!
-in Roman history,

899
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:44,617
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

900
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:01,926
Whoa! Whoa!

901
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:09,225
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

902
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:12,020
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

903
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:14,564
This is not it!
This is not it!

904
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:17,233
Marcus Aurelius is dead,
Maximus.

905
01:43:17,317 --> 01:43:20,528
We mortals are but
shadows and dust.

906
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,990
- Shadows and dust, Maximus!

907
01:43:24,074 --> 01:43:27,410
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

908
01:43:27,494 --> 01:43:31,331
Caesar is proud
to give you...

909
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:34,709
Aelius Maximus!

910
01:43:40,799 --> 01:43:45,261
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

911
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:48,098
Maximus! Maximus!

912
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:50,433
They embrace him like
he's one of their own.

913
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:54,187
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

914
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:57,107
Maximus! Maximus!

915
01:43:57,148 --> 01:44:00,193
No, much sooner
than that.

916
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,531
It's been arranged.

917
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:13,373
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

918
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:24,926
We who are about to die salute you.

919
01:44:28,555 --> 01:44:31,099
We're with you, Maximus!

920
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,393
Come on, finish it!

921
01:45:41,169 --> 01:45:43,755
- No!
- Pull! Pull!

922
01:45:57,519 --> 01:46:00,230
- Aah!

923
01:46:05,819 --> 01:46:07,696
Yeah!

924
01:46:16,955 --> 01:46:19,457
Loose! Loose!
Loose! Loose!

925
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:37,058
Aah!

926
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,647
Aah!

927
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:48,737
Get him!
Kill him!

928
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:52,324
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

929
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:55,368
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

930
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:58,496
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

931
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:01,666
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

932
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,753
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

933
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:09,049
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

934
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:12,093
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

935
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:15,013
- Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill!

936
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,599
- Kill!
- Kill!

937
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:20,643
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

938
01:47:20,727 --> 01:47:24,773
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

939
01:47:24,856 --> 01:47:28,360
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

940
01:47:28,443 --> 01:47:32,113
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

941
01:47:32,197 --> 01:47:35,200
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

942
01:47:35,283 --> 01:47:38,995
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

943
01:47:52,884 --> 01:47:55,970
Maximus!
Maximus the Merciful!

944
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:59,099
Maximus the Merciful!

945
01:48:03,645 --> 01:48:05,939
Maximus the Merciful!

946
01:48:06,022 --> 01:48:07,982
Maximus! Maximus!

947
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:10,360
Maximus! Maximus!

948
01:48:10,402 --> 01:48:14,698
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

949
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:17,367
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

950
01:48:17,575 --> 01:48:21,204
Forward, guards! On battery!

951
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:23,248
Maximus! Maximus!

952
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:29,796
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

953
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:32,215
Maximus!
Maximus!

954
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:54,821
What am I going
to do with you?

955
01:48:54,904 --> 01:48:57,490
You simply won't...

956
01:48:57,574 --> 01:48:59,492
die.

957
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:06,499
Are we so different,
you and l?

958
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:08,543
You take life
when you have to...

959
01:49:08,626 --> 01:49:10,628
as I do.

960
01:49:10,712 --> 01:49:14,758
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

961
01:49:14,841 --> 01:49:17,135
Then take it now.

962
01:49:29,898 --> 01:49:32,525
They tell me your son...

963
01:49:32,567 --> 01:49:34,903
squealed like a girl...

964
01:49:34,986 --> 01:49:37,822
when they nailed him
to the cross.

965
01:49:37,906 --> 01:49:42,535
And your wife...
moaned like a whore...

966
01:49:44,663 --> 01:49:46,790
when they ravaged her...

967
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:49,167
again and again...

968
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:52,462
and again.

969
01:49:57,258 --> 01:50:00,929
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end.

970
01:50:05,809 --> 01:50:07,936
Highness.

971
01:50:19,406 --> 01:50:23,451
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

972
01:50:23,493 --> 01:50:26,913
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

973
01:50:26,997 --> 01:50:31,960
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

974
01:50:33,962 --> 01:50:37,507
General! General!

975
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:39,467
General!

976
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:42,220
- General! General!
- Get back!

977
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:44,806
- General!
- Cicero!

978
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:47,851
Maximus! Maximus!

979
01:50:47,934 --> 01:50:50,145
- General!

980
01:50:50,228 --> 01:50:52,814
- General.
- Where are you camped?

981
01:50:52,897 --> 01:50:56,443
- Ostia.
- Maximus! Maximus!

982
01:50:56,526 --> 01:51:00,739
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

983
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:03,616
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

984
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,411
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

985
01:51:06,453 --> 01:51:09,581
- Move along!
- Find me!

986
01:51:09,664 --> 01:51:14,336
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

987
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:36,149
Can they hear you?

988
01:51:39,194 --> 01:51:41,112
Who?

989
01:51:41,196 --> 01:51:44,199
Your family,
in the afterlife.

990
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,119
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?

991
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,334
To my boy,

992
01:51:54,376 --> 01:51:56,628
I tell him I will
see him again soon.

993
01:51:56,711 --> 01:52:01,216
To keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

994
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:04,803
To my wife-

995
01:52:06,721 --> 01:52:09,015
That is not
your business.

996
01:52:16,356 --> 01:52:19,401
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

997
01:52:20,944 --> 01:52:24,197
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful!

998
01:52:25,824 --> 01:52:30,245
The whole thing's
like some crazed nightmare.

999
01:52:31,287 --> 01:52:33,748
He is defying you.

1000
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:36,793
His every victory
is an act of defiance.

1001
01:52:36,835 --> 01:52:40,922
The mob sees this,
and so do the senate.

1002
01:52:40,964 --> 01:52:45,427
Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.

1003
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:47,595
- Kill him.
- No.

1004
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,766
I will not make
a martyr of him.

1005
01:52:57,355 --> 01:52:59,524
I have been told...

1006
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:01,526
of a certain sea snake...

1007
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:05,947
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1008
01:53:06,031 --> 01:53:10,702
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1009
01:53:10,785 --> 01:53:13,038
Then its enemies
will approach,

1010
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:16,041
and yet it will
lie quite still.

1011
01:53:16,124 --> 01:53:20,420
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1012
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,797
and yet it remains...

1013
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:25,508
still.

1014
01:53:27,052 --> 01:53:29,346
So,

1015
01:53:29,429 --> 01:53:31,973
we will lie still...

1016
01:53:32,057 --> 01:53:35,602
and let our enemies
come to us and nibble.

1017
01:53:35,685 --> 01:53:39,105
Have every senator followed.

1018
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,120
Maximus.

1019
01:53:55,664 --> 01:53:57,624
Cicero, my old friend.

1020
01:53:57,666 --> 01:53:59,709
I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1021
01:53:59,793 --> 01:54:02,045
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1022
01:54:02,128 --> 01:54:04,464
How long have the men
been in Ostia?

1023
01:54:04,547 --> 01:54:07,509
- All winter.
- And how do they look?

1024
01:54:07,592 --> 01:54:09,803
Fattened and bored.

1025
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:11,846
Who's in command?

1026
01:54:11,888 --> 01:54:14,849
Some fool from Rome.

1027
01:54:14,891 --> 01:54:18,353
- How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?
- For you, tomorrow.

1028
01:54:20,021 --> 01:54:22,649
I need you to
do something for me.

1029
01:54:26,987 --> 01:54:28,905
Come see. Witness.

1030
01:54:28,989 --> 01:54:31,825
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1031
01:54:31,908 --> 01:54:36,371
Giant Maximus is defeating
our Emperor Commodus. What are we to do?

1032
01:54:36,454 --> 01:54:39,207
He's defying everyone.
What will we do?

1033
01:54:39,249 --> 01:54:42,002
- Ah! Look at that!

1034
01:54:42,085 --> 01:54:44,546
- Oh, he got him!

1035
01:54:44,587 --> 01:54:47,215
Give way! Give way!

1036
01:54:47,257 --> 01:54:49,384
Give way!

1037
01:54:51,261 --> 01:54:53,888
Three casks of red wine.

1038
01:54:53,972 --> 01:54:56,516
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1039
01:54:56,599 --> 01:54:58,518
-Back.
- Mylady.

1040
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:00,562
I served your father
at Vindobona.

1041
01:55:00,645 --> 01:55:03,398
- Back!
- And I served the General Maximus.

1042
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:05,734
I serve him still.

1043
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,736
Stop.

1044
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:09,946
- Stop.
-Stop!

1045
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:13,283
Stand back.

1046
01:55:13,366 --> 01:55:16,119
The General sends word.
He will meet your politician.

1047
01:55:18,288 --> 01:55:22,459
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1048
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:24,919
Hup!

1049
01:55:31,343 --> 01:55:33,803
Leave us.

1050
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:40,352
Senator Gracchus.

1051
01:55:53,907 --> 01:55:56,201
General.

1052
01:55:56,242 --> 01:56:00,288
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough that...

1053
01:56:00,372 --> 01:56:02,290
you can trust me.

1054
01:56:06,044 --> 01:56:08,546
- The senate is with you?
- The senate?

1055
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:13,885
Yes. I can speak for them.

1056
01:56:13,927 --> 01:56:17,430
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1057
01:56:17,514 --> 01:56:20,433
To what end?

1058
01:56:20,475 --> 01:56:23,269
Get me outside
the city walls.

1059
01:56:23,311 --> 01:56:27,315
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army's encamped there.

1060
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:30,986
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1061
01:56:31,069 --> 01:56:34,614
But the legions all have new commanders
loyal to Commodus.

1062
01:56:34,698 --> 01:56:37,951
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1063
01:56:37,993 --> 01:56:40,120
This is madness.

1064
01:56:40,203 --> 01:56:43,665
- No Roman army has entered
the capital in a hundred years.
- Gracchus-

1065
01:56:43,707 --> 01:56:45,625
I will not trade
one dictatorship for another!

1066
01:56:45,667 --> 01:56:50,505
The time for half-measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1067
01:56:50,588 --> 01:56:54,092
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1068
01:56:54,175 --> 01:56:57,637
You'll take your
5,000 warriors and leave?

1069
01:56:57,721 --> 01:57:00,056
I will leave.

1070
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:03,852
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,
under the command of the senate.

1071
01:57:03,935 --> 01:57:07,313
So, once all
of Rome is yours,

1072
01:57:07,397 --> 01:57:10,358
you'll just give it
back to the people?

1073
01:57:10,442 --> 01:57:12,402
Tell me why.

1074
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:20,618
Because that was the
last wish of a dying man.

1075
01:57:24,372 --> 01:57:26,291
I will kill Commodus.

1076
01:57:28,168 --> 01:57:31,629
The fate of Rome
I leave to you.

1077
01:57:33,131 --> 01:57:35,717
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1078
01:57:37,218 --> 01:57:39,637
His daughter trusts you.

1079
01:57:43,183 --> 01:57:45,268
I will trust you.

1080
01:57:45,352 --> 01:57:47,854
But we have little time.

1081
01:57:47,937 --> 01:57:50,023
Give me two days...

1082
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:53,318
and I will buy your freedom.

1083
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:56,154
And you-

1084
01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:58,990
You stay alive.

1085
01:57:59,074 --> 01:58:01,409
Or I'll be dead.

1086
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:04,621
Now we must go.

1087
01:58:09,793 --> 01:58:12,212
It won't work.

1088
01:58:12,253 --> 01:58:15,340
The Emperor
knows too much.

1089
01:58:15,382 --> 01:58:17,384
And as for me,

1090
01:58:18,551 --> 01:58:21,721
it's becoming dangerous.

1091
01:58:21,805 --> 01:58:24,265
You will be paid
on my return.

1092
01:58:26,059 --> 01:58:28,186
- I give you my word.

1093
01:58:28,228 --> 01:58:30,939
Your word?
What if you don't return?

1094
01:58:31,022 --> 01:58:34,442
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1095
01:58:34,526 --> 01:58:37,070
Trust?

1096
01:58:40,532 --> 01:58:42,450
Who am I to trust?

1097
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:45,245
I will kill Commodus.

1098
01:58:45,286 --> 01:58:47,288
Why would I want that?

1099
01:58:47,372 --> 01:58:49,290
He makes me rich.

1100
01:58:51,876 --> 01:58:54,087
Oh, l-

1101
01:58:54,129 --> 01:58:57,424
I know that you are
a man of your word, General.

1102
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,428
I know that you
would die for honor.

1103
01:59:02,929 --> 01:59:05,473
You would
die for Rome.

1104
01:59:05,557 --> 01:59:07,976
You would die for
the memory of your ancestors.

1105
01:59:08,059 --> 01:59:10,854
But l,
on the other hand-

1106
01:59:14,024 --> 01:59:15,942
I'm an entertainer.

1107
01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:20,405
Hmm? Guard!

1108
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:27,370
He killed the man
who set you free.

1109
01:59:33,629 --> 01:59:36,049
Praetorians, master.

1110
01:59:42,096 --> 01:59:44,057
Halt!

1111
01:59:53,983 --> 01:59:56,069
Where have you been?

1112
01:59:56,152 --> 01:59:58,112
I sent for you.

1113
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,240
Please, brother.

1114
02:00:05,787 --> 02:00:07,705
What's troubling you?

1115
02:00:10,958 --> 02:00:13,419
Does Gracchus
have a new lover?

1116
02:00:15,171 --> 02:00:17,090
I don't know.

1117
02:00:18,341 --> 02:00:20,259
I thought you'd seen him.

1118
02:00:21,678 --> 02:00:24,430
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1119
02:00:25,682 --> 02:00:27,975
For the health of Rome,
the senate must be bled.

1120
02:00:29,477 --> 02:00:31,396
And he will bleed, too.

1121
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:34,190
Very soon.

1122
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:37,568
But not tonight.

1123
02:00:51,499 --> 02:00:53,918
Do you remember what
our father said once?

1124
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:58,089
"It's a dream-

1125
02:00:59,924 --> 02:01:02,468
a frightful dream-

1126
02:01:04,387 --> 02:01:06,556
Life is."

1127
02:01:08,349 --> 02:01:10,601
Do you think that's true?

1128
02:01:10,685 --> 02:01:13,229
I don't know.

1129
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:18,109
I think it is.

1130
02:01:20,653 --> 02:01:23,323
And I have only you
to share it with.

1131
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:03,154
Open your mouth.

1132
02:02:39,482 --> 02:02:41,609
You know I love you.

1133
02:02:43,736 --> 02:02:45,989
And I love you.

1134
02:03:21,691 --> 02:03:24,110
Out. Get out!

1135
02:03:24,193 --> 02:03:26,571
Move!

1136
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:32,744
Congratulations, General.

1137
02:03:32,827 --> 02:03:36,289
You've got very...
persuasive friends.

1138
02:03:41,627 --> 02:03:44,130
My brother's had
Gracchus arrested.

1139
02:03:44,213 --> 02:03:48,217
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1140
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:52,013
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1141
02:03:52,096 --> 02:03:54,891
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1142
02:03:57,643 --> 02:03:59,604
You have done all this?

1143
02:03:59,645 --> 02:04:02,523
- Yes.
- You risk too much.

1144
02:04:03,941 --> 02:04:06,361
I have much to pay for.

1145
02:04:08,112 --> 02:04:10,031
You have nothing to pay for.

1146
02:04:10,114 --> 02:04:13,701
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1147
02:04:16,871 --> 02:04:20,583
I am tired of being strong.

1148
02:04:20,667 --> 02:04:23,419
My brother hates all the world,

1149
02:04:23,503 --> 02:04:25,421
and you most of all.

1150
02:04:25,505 --> 02:04:29,384
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1151
02:04:30,468 --> 02:04:33,012
Because my father loved you.

1152
02:04:36,557 --> 02:04:39,394
And because I loved you.

1153
02:04:41,562 --> 02:04:43,523
A long time ago.

1154
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:49,904
Was I very different then?

1155
02:04:56,619 --> 02:04:58,538
You laughed more.

1156
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:06,087
I have felt alone
all my life,

1157
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:08,256
except with you.

1158
02:05:10,967 --> 02:05:12,885
I must go.

1159
02:05:12,969 --> 02:05:15,555
Yes.

1160
02:05:42,165 --> 02:05:44,292
There. There.

1161
02:05:44,375 --> 02:05:47,795
- There. There. There.
There. There. There.

1162
02:05:47,879 --> 02:05:50,006
There. There. There.

1163
02:05:50,089 --> 02:05:52,175
There. There. There.

1164
02:05:52,258 --> 02:05:54,761
- There. There. There. There.

1165
02:05:54,844 --> 02:05:56,763
And I've got you.

1166
02:05:59,432 --> 02:06:01,893
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1167
02:06:01,934 --> 02:06:04,312
I'm not a legionnaire.

1168
02:06:04,395 --> 02:06:06,564
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1169
02:06:08,149 --> 02:06:12,028
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1170
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:14,197
Wouldn't you rather be...

1171
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,449
a great Roman warrior
like Julius Caesar?

1172
02:06:16,532 --> 02:06:19,619
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

1173
02:06:21,245 --> 02:06:23,581
The savior of Rome?

1174
02:06:31,923 --> 02:06:33,841
And who said that?

1175
02:06:42,433 --> 02:06:44,852
Where's Lucius?

1176
02:06:44,894 --> 02:06:46,854
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1177
02:06:50,692 --> 02:06:53,736
-She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1178
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:57,407
She took it from a basket
and pressed it to her breast,

1179
02:06:57,490 --> 02:06:59,409
right here
above her heart.

1180
02:07:01,536 --> 02:07:03,788
It bit her in the breast?

1181
02:07:03,871 --> 02:07:05,790
Yes.

1182
02:07:05,873 --> 02:07:08,918
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies...

1183
02:07:09,002 --> 02:07:12,797
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1184
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,799
I think it's silly.

1185
02:07:14,882 --> 02:07:16,801
So do l.

1186
02:07:18,302 --> 02:07:20,263
So do l.

1187
02:07:20,304 --> 02:07:22,473
Sister, join us.

1188
02:07:22,557 --> 02:07:24,767
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1189
02:07:24,851 --> 02:07:27,562
- I've been reading too.
- Yes.

1190
02:07:27,603 --> 02:07:29,564
He's a very clever
little boy.

1191
02:07:29,605 --> 02:07:32,734
He'll make a grand
emperor one day.

1192
02:07:32,775 --> 02:07:36,487
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1193
02:07:36,571 --> 02:07:38,656
The queen killed herself
with a snake.

1194
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:41,951
And just wait until you hear what
happened to our ancestors.

1195
02:07:42,035 --> 02:07:44,537
If you're very good,

1196
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:48,666
tomorrow night I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1197
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,461
He was betrayed...

1198
02:07:51,544 --> 02:07:53,796
by those closest to him.

1199
02:07:55,173 --> 02:07:57,091
By his own blood.

1200
02:07:58,676 --> 02:08:01,179
They whispered in dark corners...

1201
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:03,181
and went out
late at night...

1202
02:08:03,222 --> 02:08:05,892
and conspired...

1203
02:08:05,975 --> 02:08:07,977
and conspired.

1204
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:12,482
But the Emperor Claudius
knew that they were up to something.

1205
02:08:13,691 --> 02:08:16,027
He knew they were
busy little bees.

1206
02:08:18,071 --> 02:08:21,824
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

1207
02:08:21,908 --> 02:08:24,452
and he looked at her...

1208
02:08:24,535 --> 02:08:26,454
and he said,

1209
02:08:27,538 --> 02:08:30,708
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1210
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,710
busy little bee,

1211
02:08:34,754 --> 02:08:38,007
or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1212
02:08:38,091 --> 02:08:42,512
You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood. "

1213
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:48,226
And the Emperor
was heartbroken.

1214
02:08:50,144 --> 02:08:52,605
The little bee had
wounded him more deeply...

1215
02:08:52,647 --> 02:08:55,817
than anyone else
could ever have done.

1216
02:08:57,235 --> 02:09:01,155
And what do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1217
02:09:01,239 --> 02:09:03,658
I don't know, Uncle.

1218
02:09:09,247 --> 02:09:11,499
The little bee
told him everything.

1219
02:09:51,205 --> 02:09:54,834
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1220
02:09:54,917 --> 02:09:56,836
Proximo!

1221
02:09:56,919 --> 02:10:00,381
Open the gates in the name
of the Emperor!

1222
02:10:00,465 --> 02:10:03,301
- Proximo!

1223
02:10:03,384 --> 02:10:06,012
Open the gates!

1224
02:10:11,851 --> 02:10:14,604
Open the gates, Proximo!

1225
02:10:14,646 --> 02:10:17,774
Do you want to die, old man?

1226
02:10:17,815 --> 02:10:20,109
Here.

1227
02:10:20,193 --> 02:10:22,487
Everything is prepared.

1228
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:25,490
- It seems you've won your freedom.
- Proximo,

1229
02:10:25,573 --> 02:10:28,201
are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1230
02:10:28,284 --> 02:10:29,952
Ha!

1231
02:10:33,247 --> 02:10:37,126
-Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1232
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:41,464
Open the gates!
The Emperor commands!

1233
02:10:45,301 --> 02:10:47,512
Pull!

1234
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:52,475
Move! Two columns on the left!

1235
02:10:55,603 --> 02:10:58,398
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1236
02:10:58,481 --> 02:11:01,901
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1237
02:11:01,985 --> 02:11:03,903
We'll wait here for you,
Maximus.

1238
02:11:03,987 --> 02:11:06,864
- Strength and honor.
- Go!

1239
02:11:07,991 --> 02:11:10,910
Strength and honor.

1240
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:15,665
Aim! Break the bars!

1241
02:12:21,898 --> 02:12:23,858
Shadows and dust.

1242
02:12:23,941 --> 02:12:25,985
Aah!

1243
02:13:04,315 --> 02:13:06,651
- Maximus!

1244
02:13:11,322 --> 02:13:13,366
I'm sorry.

1245
02:13:13,449 --> 02:13:15,743
No!

1246
02:13:40,018 --> 02:13:41,936
It's done.

1247
02:13:48,609 --> 02:13:51,112
And what of my nephew?

1248
02:13:51,154 --> 02:13:53,614
And what of his mother?

1249
02:13:55,491 --> 02:13:58,244
Should they share
her lover's fate?

1250
02:13:59,871 --> 02:14:02,332
Or should
I be merciful?

1251
02:14:04,625 --> 02:14:07,045
Commodus the Merciful.

1252
02:14:13,092 --> 02:14:16,262
Lucius will stay with me now.

1253
02:14:16,346 --> 02:14:19,557
And if his mother...

1254
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:23,019
so much as looks at me...

1255
02:14:23,102 --> 02:14:26,064
in a manner that displeases me,

1256
02:14:27,357 --> 02:14:29,317
he will die.

1257
02:14:32,445 --> 02:14:34,697
If she decides...

1258
02:14:34,739 --> 02:14:37,325
to be noble...

1259
02:14:37,408 --> 02:14:40,953
and takes her own life,

1260
02:14:41,037 --> 02:14:42,955
he will die.

1261
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:47,669
And as for you,

1262
02:14:50,546 --> 02:14:53,132
you will love me...

1263
02:14:53,216 --> 02:14:55,343
as I loved you.

1264
02:14:56,594 --> 02:14:59,055
You will provide me
with an heir...

1265
02:14:59,097 --> 02:15:01,391
of pure blood...

1266
02:15:01,432 --> 02:15:04,435
so that Commodus
and his progeny...

1267
02:15:04,477 --> 02:15:06,938
will rule for
a thousand years.

1268
02:15:11,067 --> 02:15:13,528
Am I not merciful?

1269
02:15:34,841 --> 02:15:37,260
Am I not merciful?

1270
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:51,607
Maximus! Maximus!

1271
02:15:51,691 --> 02:15:54,527
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

1272
02:15:54,569 --> 02:15:57,363
Maximus! Maximus!

1273
02:15:57,447 --> 02:15:59,699
Maximus! Maximus!

1274
02:15:59,782 --> 02:16:01,868
Maximus! Maximus!

1275
02:16:01,909 --> 02:16:05,872
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

1276
02:16:05,913 --> 02:16:08,875
Maximus! Maximus!

1277
02:16:08,916 --> 02:16:11,627
Maximus! Maximus!

1278
02:16:11,711 --> 02:16:14,255
Maximus! Maximus!

1279
02:16:14,339 --> 02:16:16,257
Maximus! Maximus!

1280
02:16:16,341 --> 02:16:18,718
Maximus! Maximus!

1281
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,970
Maximus! Maximus!

1282
02:16:21,054 --> 02:16:24,307
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1283
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:27,393
Maximus! Maximus!

1284
02:16:27,477 --> 02:16:29,771
Maximus! Maximus!

1285
02:16:34,192 --> 02:16:36,361
Maximus.

1286
02:16:36,444 --> 02:16:38,613
Maximus.

1287
02:16:38,696 --> 02:16:40,657
Maximus.

1288
02:16:41,866 --> 02:16:43,951
They call for you.

1289
02:16:45,578 --> 02:16:49,332
The general
who became a slave.

1290
02:16:49,415 --> 02:16:52,669
The slave
who became a gladiator.

1291
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,048
The gladiator
who defied an emperor.

1292
02:16:58,716 --> 02:17:01,344
A striking story.

1293
02:17:01,427 --> 02:17:04,389
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1294
02:17:06,891 --> 02:17:09,143
Only a famous death will do.

1295
02:17:10,728 --> 02:17:13,690
And what could be
more glorious...

1296
02:17:13,731 --> 02:17:17,694
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1297
02:17:20,071 --> 02:17:22,365
You would fight me?

1298
02:17:22,407 --> 02:17:26,119
Why not?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1299
02:17:27,328 --> 02:17:30,123
I think you have been afraid
all your life.

1300
02:17:30,206 --> 02:17:34,335
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1301
02:17:39,966 --> 02:17:44,262
I knew a man who once said,
" Death smiles at us all.

1302
02:17:44,303 --> 02:17:47,473
All a man can do
is smile back."

1303
02:17:47,557 --> 02:17:50,226
I wonder.

1304
02:17:50,310 --> 02:17:52,729
Did your friend
smile at his own death?

1305
02:17:53,813 --> 02:17:55,732
You must know.

1306
02:17:58,151 --> 02:18:00,486
He was your father.

1307
02:18:03,823 --> 02:18:07,493
You loved my father,
I know.

1308
02:18:07,577 --> 02:18:09,495
But so did l.

1309
02:18:10,580 --> 02:18:12,790
That makes us brothers,
doesn't it?

1310
02:18:15,043 --> 02:18:17,879
Smile for me now, brother.

1311
02:18:21,716 --> 02:18:24,427
- Strap on his armor.

1312
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:27,221
Conceal the wound.

1313
02:18:32,977 --> 02:18:34,729
Maximus! Maximus!

1314
02:18:34,812 --> 02:18:37,565
Maximus! Maximus!

1315
02:19:19,941 --> 02:19:21,943
Ring formation!

1316
02:19:22,026 --> 02:19:24,821
Ring formation!

1317
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:57,520
Off with his head, Maximus!

1318
02:21:01,709 --> 02:21:05,380
- Aah!

1319
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:15,139
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1320
02:21:15,223 --> 02:21:17,600
Quintus, sword!

1321
02:21:17,642 --> 02:21:20,436
Give me your sword!

1322
02:21:22,438 --> 02:21:24,983
Sword! Give me a sword!

1323
02:21:25,066 --> 02:21:27,860
- Sheathe your swords!

1324
02:21:27,944 --> 02:21:30,947
Sheathe yours swords!

1325
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:47,458
Maximus.

1326
02:23:51,504 --> 02:23:55,008
- Maximus.
- Quintus.

1327
02:23:56,926 --> 02:23:59,846
Free my men.

1328
02:23:59,929 --> 02:24:02,473
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1329
02:24:03,558 --> 02:24:05,560
There was a dream
that was Rome.

1330
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:09,439
It shall be realized.

1331
02:24:09,522 --> 02:24:12,066
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1332
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:15,069
Free the prisoners!
Go!

1333
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:40,928
Maximus!

1334
02:24:42,805 --> 02:24:45,099
Lucius is safe.

1335
02:25:00,615 --> 02:25:02,700
Go to them.

1336
02:25:50,873 --> 02:25:53,334
You're home.

1337
02:26:19,402 --> 02:26:22,822
Is Rome worth
one good man's life?

1338
02:26:26,451 --> 02:26:28,703
We believed it once.

1339
02:26:30,788 --> 02:26:32,749
Make us
believe it again.

1340
02:26:37,128 --> 02:26:39,589
He was a soldier of Rome.

1341
02:26:43,009 --> 02:26:45,345
Honor him.

1342
02:26:45,428 --> 02:26:47,847
Who will help me carry him?

1343
02:27:31,808 --> 02:27:34,268
Now we are free.

1344
02:27:39,774 --> 02:27:42,360
I will see you again.

1345
02:27:44,487 --> 02:27:47,073
But not yet.

1346
02:27:47,115 --> 02:27:49,075
Not yet.
