1
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:30,951
At the end of the 21st century, the Earth has been sick,
Contaminated and overpopulation.

2
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:51,817
Earth's richest residents to leave the planet
To preserve their lifestyle

3
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:29,397
Elysium

4
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,653
Max!

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,310
Come quickly.

6
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,303
Do not wait for the sisters.

7
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:05,539
It Frey.

8
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:09,597
He's also a new kid here.

9
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,256
You can read?

10
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,771
It's a giraffe.
He lived in Africa.

11
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,101
You can read?

12
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,317
Yes.

13
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:38,039
There are a lot of robot helpers there,
And they serve all day.

14
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,238
If you live there, you would not
Never been sick, or get old.

15
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,204
I'm going to take us there one day.

16
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,225
Really?
Yes, I promise.

17
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:52,006
Frey and Max.

18
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,332
Forever.

19
00:02:56,672 --> 00:03:00,244
Max, what else did you steal?

20
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,339
You made me disappointed.
Why are you doing this?

21
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:09,024
So you can save money?

22
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:12,539
So you'll be able to buy tickets to go up there?

23
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:28,150
That place is not for you, or me.

24
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,132
But it's not fair, Sister.

25
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,965
Why should I not go there?

26
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,329
Sometimes there are some things that do not
Can be explained in life.

27
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,957
Why should all work properly.

28
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,263
But one thing I know.

29
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,114
You are something special.

30
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,978
Someday you're going to do
Something extraordinary.

31
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:50,665
Something that is destined for you.

32
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,165
My little Max.

33
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,020
Go to work, huh?
Beware not to burn.

34
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,603
Make this world so much better.

35
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,774
It's funny, I had no job.
I'll see you later.

36
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,435
Little friend, you think I have money?

37
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,767
What I seem to have money?

38
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,313
What about you, do you have any money?

39
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,326
Come on, what have you got in there?

40
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,165
Oh, wait a minute.

41
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,820
Wait.

42
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:08,042
Oh, it's 5 dollar.
Hey, wait a minute.

43
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,258
I had 5 dollars and I'm rich.
You know what that means?

44
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:14,866
So I can go to Elysium, huh?

45
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,427
All right.

46
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:30,329
Please immediately lined up.
Bus you've arrived.

47
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:36,923
I did not bring anything.

48
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,158
Do not touch me.

49
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,511
Clean.
Go on.

50
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,507
Good morning, Officer.

51
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:56,626
Detected criminals. Caught many times.
What's in your bag?

52
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,172
Hair Gel, mostly.

53
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,538
I'm just kidding.

54
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:05,161
Hey, hey .. I just want to work, man.
There is nothing in the bag.

55
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,541
Come on, I ...

56
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,697
Against the officer is an offense.

57
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,520
I just want to work, man.
Come on.

58
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,144
Clean.
I told you there's no nothing.

59
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,792
There is no tolerance and it also
Applicable to other citizens.

60
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,993
Really?

61
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:26,004
You must immediately report to
Parole officer.

62
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,309
Thank you, Citizen city.

63
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,330
No, thank you.

64
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,511
Frey, fractured two bones in the booth.

65
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:51,759
Max?

66
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,440
Frey ...

67
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,204
I thought you were ...

68
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,452
When did you come back?
It's a long time.

69
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,657
I see nothing has changed here.
No, it's not my fault.

70
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,661
Of course not. Let me see it.
How?

71
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,535
Broken really badly.

72
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,731
So you made it so a nurse, huh?

73
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,269
Yes.

74
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,584
That's good.

75
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,916
You still steal cars?

76
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,685
No, I did not do such a stupid thing again.

77
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,239
I worked in Armadyne.
I was on track, you know?

78
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:28,362
Frey, they need you on the 3rd floor.
I'll be right there.

79
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,608
So, you know, because you've come back ...
Wait a minute.

80
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,276
Just a minute.

81
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,427
Dominican, could replace me here?

82
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:41,464
Hey, listen, because you're back ...
Max, sorry I have to go.

83
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,294
Nice to meet you.
Stay away from the problem.

84
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,043
It is.

85
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,249
Listen ...

86
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,801
I know why you're gone,
I understand.

87
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:05,013
I just wanted to build
Go back a long relationship.

88
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:06,912
Dinner was with me.

89
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,716
I'll make coffee.

90
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,914
Not.
God.

91
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,004
I had to break my hand only
To get your attention?

92
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:17,741
Because I'll do it.
Stop it.

93
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,255
My life is complicated, Max.

94
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:25,424
I'm just, I'm ...
I miss you.

95
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,769
Shift I finished at 8 Wednesday, ok?
Yes, all right.

96
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,377
Coffee.
Yes, coffee. Good.

97
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,602
Get out of here.

98
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:46,769
Hello.

99
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,651
Before we started,
I want to explain ...

100
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,169
Max da Costa, violation of code of conduct in 2219.
Today at the bus stop 34-B.

101
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,923
Yes, that's what I want to talk.
I think it's been a misunderstanding.

102
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,362
We will extend the exemption
Bersyaratmu eight months.

103
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,461
Wait, what? No, no,
I can explain what happened.

104
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,632
I'm just kidding.
And, uh. You know ...

105
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:06,840
Stop talking.

106
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,954
The police reported antisocial behavior.

107
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:13,182
With regret we have to extend
Parole period.

108
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,865
Increased heart rate is detected.

109
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,980
You take the pill?
Not!

110
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:22,623
Thank you, I want to explain that to happen ...

111
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:28,464
Stop talking. Analysis showed personality
78.3% likely to commit aggression ...

112
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:31,589
Attack with a deadly weapon,
Resisting arrest.

113
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:35,920
You want to talk to a human?
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

114
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:39,262
What is it satire or contempt?
Negative.

115
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,002
Insulting officials is a federal crime.

116
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,300
Understood.

117
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,737
Hey! Da Costa!

118
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,579
You're late for your shift.
Yes, I have a little problem ...

119
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,712
No, no. You can not
Work with it.'re Out.

120
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,733
No, no, I'm fine.
I can work.

121
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,757
It will be released today.
I'm fine.

122
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:01,973
Are you healthy?
Healthy!

123
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,911
Okay, I pay you half a day.

124
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,491
Yes, all right.
You're lucky for it.

125
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,897
No detectable weapons.
You may enter.

126
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,103
Hey, look, man. Guess he likes you.
Did he bring his own plane these days?

127
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,545
It looks good.

128
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:47,449
If we are not able to increase profits,
Investors are we going to lose confidence.

129
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:52,276
You think what I'm doing here, on Earth?
You think I'm happy to breathe the air?

130
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,961
No, of course, but ...
I did everything that could be done ...

131
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,571
To re-boost
This company profits.

132
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,476
The company that I built myself.

133
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:03,396
Now, excuse me. I do not want to talk
With you guys again. Thank you.

134
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,166
Closing the number 34.

135
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,202
Heating the number 34.

136
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,669
Burn ID in his hand.

137
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,084
Come on, come on, we do not have much time.

138
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,141
Three transporter we have prepared, Spider.

139
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,864
All right, show on the screen.

140
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,778
Code accepted.

141
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:11,359
Turn on the plane!

142
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,115
We need Guider!

143
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:48,384
Welcome.
Hello, ma'am.

144
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:51,655
Have a look-see his garden.
Of course, thank you.

145
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,685
Halo.
Madame Delacourt.

146
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,876
Hi, It's been great, yes.

147
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,123
Hello.

148
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:02,388
What's up? Kids go?
Yes, they were together Dominica.

149
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:05,111
I have a present for you.

150
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,179
Take it with your mother.

151
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,814
There, next to the couch.

152
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,239
Lady, you want to drink fresh?
Command: Cancel.

153
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,767
Security is breached.
The code was reported stolen plane.

154
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,982
Sorry to bother you, ma'am. We saw some
Unregistered aircraft is approaching.

155
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:44,899
Good afternoon, Defense Secretary Delacourt.

156
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,547
Unregistered aircraft approaching 3
Elysium airspace.

157
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:52,834
Actions 6 and 7 are no longer effective.

158
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,053
Attention, the approaching aircraft.

159
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:09,370
You are not allowed to enter the airspace of Elysium.

160
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,621
Dad!
It's all right.

161
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,825
We will be forced to take action.

162
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:18,014
You violated the airspace of Elysium.

163
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,339
Warning standard does not work.

164
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,875
15,000 miles and is getting closer.

165
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,112
What should we do, ma'am?
Activate Kruger.

166
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:33,398
Mom, according to the executive order 355
About the illegal assets on Earth ...

167
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,654
I give you power.

168
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,392
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,656
Agent 32, we send the package.

170
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,075
Welcome, Agent Kruger!

171
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,844
10,000 miles and closer.

172
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,960
Sending coordinates on assets.

173
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:20,429
Three target data.

174
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,294
Shoot them!

175
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,916
Green light, 21-B.
Green light.

176
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:32,893
The missile was gliding!

177
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,429
Oh, shit.

178
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:19,659
Two aircraft were destroyed.
The total casualties of 46 people.

179
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,965
Collisions in 5 ...

180
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,814
Last missile failed.
That's ridiculous!

181
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,400
Only one who survived.

182
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,888
Ma'am, the plane enters our atmosphere.

183
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:55,245
The plane was registered first has landed.

184
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,608
I want everyone who dropped
The plane was captured.

185
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:30,499

00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,060

187
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,731
Broken in some parts
Detected

188
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,643
The process of reconstruction began.

189
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,527
No!

190
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:48,063
32 arrested, 13 were killed,
And 2 remain at large again, Mom.

191
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,311
Reconstruction is completed.

192
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:07,785
You have violated immigration laws.

193
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,163
All passengers have been arrested illegally, ma'am.
Yes.

194
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:15,493
Send them to deportation,
Remove them from the habitat.

195
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,433
Minister Delacourt,
Please immediately report to the President Patel.

196
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,237
Minister Delacourt,
Please report to the President Patel.

197
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,867
What's up, man?
What happened?

00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:05,881
A little trouble with the police.

199
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,771
Are you okay?
Yes, do not worry.

200
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,734
Max, I have to talk to you.
You know ...

201
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,026
Not!
What do you mean?

202
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,267
You have not even heard of
What I'm saying.

203
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,478
Well, let's say.
All right.

204
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:20,350
You know Doseta house on the hill?
Yes, there's a lot of weapons.

205
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,305
Yes, they have five cars.
It's new.

206
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:26,176
We will go three.
Tomorrow, at lunch.

207
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,757
At lunch?
That's the plan?

208
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,856
Oh my God.

209
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:33,086
You've got a better plan?
Yes, bring one person.

210
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,623
Go before sunrise,
Take two fastest cars ...

211
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,788
And burn battery more cars.

212
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:40,036
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

213
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,712
I have to do? Oh, come on.
Give me one year. One year alone.

214
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:47,611
I'm not going back to jail.
A year alone, come on!

215
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:50,801
Look at you, once you are a legend,
And now what?

216
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,325
The time was 5:50 am.

217
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:19,043
No weapon was found.
You may enter.

218
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,902
Closing the number 34.

219
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,167
The door is not functioning.

220
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:48,297
Hey, did you hold the queue.

221
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,046
No, the door jam!

222
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:57,928
What are you doing to the door jam?
No, I'm just trying resetnya me.

223
00:20:58,052 --> 00:20:59,334
Let me see.

224
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,172
Held its base.
Yes, I try removing them.

225
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:04,987
Get inside.
No, I ...

226
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:07,233
Look, you get into it now ...

227
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:10,106
Or find someone else who will,
And you can go from here.

228
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,770
Come on, man.
No. That's the deal, okay?

229
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:13,768
Begin!

230
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,637
Come on everybody, fast work!

231
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,235
Shit.

232
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:51,737
No, no, no, stop!
No, no!

233
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,852
Hey!

234
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:59,336
Organic Network detected K-34.

235
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,302
Come on! Get lost!

236
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,618
It's too late!

237
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:21,821
Extraction!

238
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:53,417
Those who start fights, Sister.

239
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,851
I just wanted to stay there.

240
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:01,723
You see how beautiful Elysium of here?

241
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes.

242
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:07,648
All right.

243
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:11,290
Now look how beautiful
We look from up there.

244
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:14,874
Save it.

245
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,477
Now it's yours.

246
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:21,720
So you'll never forget where you come from.

247
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:44,410
What happened?
You're exposed to lethal doses of radiation.

248
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:47,895
You will experience organ failure ...

249
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,858
In five days, you will die.

250
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:04,177
What happened?
Why did production stop?

251
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:07,092
He's exposure to radiation.
Do not breathe on me.

252
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:09,263
Shut your mouth.
I'm sorry, sir.

253
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:21,244
What skin to peel off?

254
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,190
I do not want to change his bed.
Get him out of there.

255
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:26,522
Yes, sir.
Well, thank you.

256
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:29,959
Mr.. Carlyle, your plane ready to go.

257
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:38,898
Please sign this
To receive treatment.

258
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,317
Miporol will be very helpful.
Your body will work fine until death.

259
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,239
Take one tablet after a meal.

260
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,413
Thank you for your ministry.

261
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:14,394
At 3 pm yesterday you shoot down two aircraft
And killed 46 civilians.

262
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:17,424
Mandatmu is clean up the
This stowaway quietly.

263
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,172
I really understand it.

264
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:22,336
And using this agent ...

265
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,584
Mr.. M. Kruger.

266
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,389
15 violations of human rights ...

267
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:29,786
Rape, kidnapping, torture.

268
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:33,116
The man was diagnosed to suffer
Serious psychological problems.

269
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:38,045
We've asked for is no longer
Using a field agent.

270
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,316
Tell me, President Patel.

271
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,855
Do you have children?

272
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,477
It's not me who is being questioned here.

273
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,297
So I assume you do not have.

274
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:53,969
Maybe, if you have children.

275
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:59,463
Then you will be to maintain
Sustainability of this habitat.

276
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:04,749
I understand, is not a wise way
To think and act like me.

277
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,580
I really understand it.

278
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:09,727
But when they get into your house ...

279
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,040
The house you build for your children.

280
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:14,071
And the son of your son ...

281
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,443
Not PR or campaign promises
That will keep them away.

282
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:19,858
But I do!

283
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:23,103
Enough is enough!
This is your last warning.

284
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:26,891
Again unauthorized use of assets,
Then you will be transferred to the Lotus.

285
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:30,872
And Kruger's agent stopped permanently.

286
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,926
Who agrees?

287
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:37,089
Good.
Effective immediately.

288
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:48,695
Renewing the core.
Agent M. Kruger
Dismissed

289
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,008
You want a beer?

290
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:13,783
You have been dismissed from the CCB.
Please return all weapons to the nearest embassy.

291
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:18,287
To hell with your political!
Fuck you!

292
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:31,630
Look at that ...

293
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:34,369
Max ...

294
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:39,688
Max!

295
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,668
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

296
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:46,239
Gosh, let me help you.
Come on.

297
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,543
Max, what happened?

298
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,630
Max, what happened?
I should not get into it.

299
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:57,662
Where to?
Oh my God.

300
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:05,030
I was exposed to a lethal dose.

301
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:06,236
The lethal dose.

302
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:10,689
Everything will be okay.
Let me help you.

303
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,057
You'll be fine, Max.
They gave Miporol.

304
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:22,800
They gave me Miporol.

305
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,878
I've only got five days!
I only had five days!

306
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,723
You have to drink it.

307
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:36,328
They can heal everything in Elysium.
I know.

308
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,323
I'm going to see Spider.
Max, Max!

309
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:41,539
Drink the medicine!

310
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,166
Good so!

311
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:50,313
To see Spider, you need money.

312
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,641
I'll give you all I've got,
But it will not be enough for a ticket.

313
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:57,639
He's going to give me a ticket.

314
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:01,435
He's going to give me a ticket.

315
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:08,210
Frey, you know we've done
Everything to help your daughter.

316
00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:11,542
But I talk to leaders, and they are
Advised her to go home with you.

317
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,088
How could I work here
And leave it at home?

318
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:16,035
You know it can happen anytime, Dr. Faizel.

319
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,948
I know, if he spasmed again, of course
Must be brought here, of course.

320
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:23,553
But he can not continue here.

321
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,797
This is not Elysium.
We can not directly cure.

322
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,443
Max!

323
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:13,774
A long time ago, my brother!

324
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,854
How's the weather affect you?

325
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:21,015
I've come to ask you a favor.
What? I can not hear you. What?

326
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:26,118
I need a ticket. Upward there.
And ID.

327
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:27,567
Oh.

328
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:30,488
Yes, yes, of course.

329
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:35,291
Of course, you want to sit in the aisle or window?

330
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,705
Do not play games with me.
I'm serious.

331
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,284
Listen, I'll be back.
I'll come back and work for you.

332
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,438
Everything you want.
I'll pay it.

333
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:49,268
You know?

334
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,989
This is ...

335
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:54,938
Priceless.

336
00:30:56,402 --> 00:31:00,049
It's priceless.

337
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,556
Well, let me ask you something.

338
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:08,423
You know how many idiots who come here
And tells the same crap?

339
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:13,357
There are kids who come here every day.

340
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:19,111
Max, if I were you.
I'm going to go from here, now ...

341
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:26,610
I was jailed for four years because of you,
You have to help me up there.

342
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:31,639
Please shoot me. I was exposed to deadly radiation
And perhaps you will also be exposed.

343
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:34,771
You're really dying?
I was actually dying.

344
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:36,916
Look at this.
Peace.

345
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:41,764
Lower the gun. Derive the gun!
Lower the gun! Get out of here!

346
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:43,719
Okay!

347
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:48,783
Listen, I'm looking for someone
To do the job for me.

348
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,946
But nobody here had the guts!

349
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,318
You said you were ready to do anything, right?

350
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:58,106
Max ...

351
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,350
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

352
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:24,274
This is ...

353
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,334
My friends.

354
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:31,322
This could be your ticket up there.

355
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,190
Final work for me,
You can be your way up there.

356
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,387
What is this?

357
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:43,301
Get the fuck out of Elysium, okay?

358
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:48,929
A millionaire who fell to Earth
To do business ...

359
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,592
He's here for, whatever.
We have kidnapped him.

360
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,681
Fuck you!
Calm down.

361
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:56,682
You can do it.
As a tourist.

362
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,348
Forget about the clock, forget his wallet,
Forget it all.

363
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:03,585
This, you have to take.

364
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,916
Organic Information,
Straight from the head.

365
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:14,368
I'm talking about the bank code,
Password, the login data ...

366
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,301
Access billions.

367
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,531
All you have to do is plug it into his brain,
Download the data to your brain with this thing ...

368
00:33:23,843 --> 00:33:25,534
And bring me.

369
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,346
It's crazy, Max, come on.

370
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:32,193
If you're looking for a doctor, I can
Give the place up there.

371
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:35,681
Plus snacks and drinks.

372
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:41,466
All you have to do is go into a house,
Use the machine, and you're cured.

373
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:44,966
Sandro who will perform the operation.
Do you know him?

374
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,355
Oh my God.

375
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,588
I'm fine.

376
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,542
Actually, you look weak.

377
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,336
And messed up once, so ...

378
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:57,685
You know, I have ...

379
00:33:57,773 --> 00:34:01,057
It's crazy, let's get out of here,
Come on, listen to me.

380
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:03,500
What should I do?

381
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,004
I would tell them to put up ...

382
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,653
This is ...

383
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,816
Wear protective third generation.

384
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,978
It will be connected to the system of nerves,
And will make you as strong as the Droid (robot).

385
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,242
You're like a knife, right?

386
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,162
Let's get out of here, please.

387
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:20,847
I need 4 people in the team.
But I alone chose it.

388
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,381
I send teknisiku own.

389
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,619
Transmitting data from the brain to the brain ...
It's hard.

390
00:34:26,717 --> 00:34:31,353
Okay, but I brought Julio, he can
Ticket up there, just like me.

391
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:32,802
Yes, of course.

392
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:35,311
Okay, I will explore the background.

393
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,494
Wait!

394
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:40,853
The person should John Carlyle.

395
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:45,021
Carlyle Armadyne the CEO?

396
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,707
That's him.

397
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,594
Minister Delacourt, Tn. Carlyle has arrived.

398
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,528
You're here to convince me to renew
Our Armadyne contract, right?

399
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,525
Decisive as usual.

400
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,175
Come with me.

401
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:18,066
I'm not interested in your little idea.

402
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:21,014
I'm interested in something more substantial.

403
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:23,367
Habitat is dying.

404
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:29,097
There is a political disease in it.
Tumors that must be removed.

405
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,121
You and your company,
It takes advantage of this crisis.

406
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,526
So ...

407
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,243
You are building Thorus.

408
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:43,549
Can you take over the server and
Putting the power of the new president?

409
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,075
Coup?

410
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:51,462
You're suggesting a coup?

411
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,253
Is that possible?

412
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,386
I can do the reboot sequence ...

413
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,642
Turning the whole system,
And at that point ...

414
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:05,020
You can coup President, yes.

415
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,014
And that's what you're gonna do.

416
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,590
And the contract will be safe for the next 200 years.

417
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:16,656
Defense against missile battery, Droid, everything
We need to maintain our independence.

418
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:21,596
Of course, all guaranteed by the ...
Your new president.

419
00:36:28,304 --> 00:36:31,602
Go on, you have a job, Mr.. Carlyle.

420
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,102
This is the guy.

421
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,988
He's the guy?
This is it.

422
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:43,340
Sit down.

423
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:47,124
Good job, man.

424
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:50,789
Take your time.
Slow down.

425
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,989
We gave her ID first.

426
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:54,923
We started with his ID first,

427
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,065
Prepare.

428
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:08,812
It will be linked to your DNA.
You ready?

429
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,370
It'll be fun.

430
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:34,559
Hey, man.

431
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:36,182
Yo.

432
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:38,812
What is this pain?

433
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,682
Yes, it will hurt.

434
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:44,228
It's going to hurt like hell.

435
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:47,575
When we are done you will be a ninja, huh?

436
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,143
Mariana!

437
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,666
Hey, bone saws bring it here!

438
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,721
It's not going to kill me.

439
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:01,607
You'll be fine.
Not bad.

440
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:04,027
Max.

441
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:06,985
I'm here.

442
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,223
We can do this, right?

443
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,305
We can do this.

444
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:15,277
Yes.

445
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,168
Hey!

446
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,290
He's awake!

447
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,383
You did, huh?

448
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,642
Amazing.

449
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,712
You can still masturbate, right?

450
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,336
How is she?

451
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,357
He's ready for action.

452
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,232
What are you doing to me?

453
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:38,730
Give you a way out.

454
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,608
Restart the protocol.

455
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,545
The order is completed.

456
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:07,387
You want to secure this data?
Yes No

457
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,408
Yes

458
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:13,990
Options:
A. Disable
B. Deadly.

459
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,001
Deadly.

460
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:19,099
Ready to upload to the brain.

461
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,113
Hey!

462
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:35,937
What's up, man?

463
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:38,696
How does it feel to wear that?

464
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,094
It seems very tight.

465
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:43,739
Show me.

466
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,074
Hold this.

467
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,034
Easy to use.
Just wait.

468
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,273
The ammunition that exploded in the air.

469
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:01,914
Blow up the enemy ...

470
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:06,165
Any ammo you shoot him
Will explode in a radius of 5 meters.

471
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:07,796
And ...

472
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:11,496
The explosion hardest by this naughty boy.

473
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:13,590
Time to work.

474
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,450
Sir ...

475
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,234
Your plane is ready.

476
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,058
On the way.

477
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:50,764
Do you hear me?

478
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:52,263
Yes.

479
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:58,875
All right, here's how it works.
We did not move until the plane departed.

480
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:03,427
Shoot plane with explosives,
We're surrounded when his plane crashed.

481
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,060
Okay, understood.

482
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,471
Explosive activated.

483
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:15,344
Come on, everyone.
Here we go.

484
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,261
Are you nervous?

485
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:28,205
Not.
No?

486
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,718
I got shat in my pants.

487
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:40,305
I will not die.
Not.

488
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,280
Come on, come on, come on!

489
00:43:19,184 --> 00:43:23,104
Acceleration supersonic speed within 15 seconds.

490
00:43:33,606 --> 00:43:35,454
Come on, Come on, Come on!

491
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:42,466
Blow, 3, 2, 1 ...

492
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,857
There was an engine failure.

493
00:43:48,816 --> 00:43:51,863
Mom, there are people Elysium on Earth
Being in danger.

494
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,419
Bring up the data now ...

495
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:58,611
The people are identified.
John Carlyle. N8321 ...

496
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,886
I see you, fucker.

497
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,839
I've got a problem here.

498
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:09,342
Kruger, you hear me?

499
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:13,169
Ah, Mrs. Delacourt.
I love to hear your voice.

500
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:16,590
There are people who are carrying
Sensitive data in the city now.

501
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:18,967
A group of thieves trying to hijack it.

502
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,081
The citizens of what?

503
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:21,427
That's a secret.

504
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:27,264
You can not call the agent is not active,
For confidential information, eh?

505
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:29,706
The government does not know about that, right?

506
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:32,248
I can do it at will, right?

507
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,928
Preparing for the collision.

508
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,871
Please remain calm.
You do not suffer an injury.

509
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:50,902
Oh, it's very calming.

510
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:59,331
With one condition, if I do this,
I re-enabled.

511
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:00,582
All right.

512
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:03,136
I reassign two anggotamu.

513
00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:08,187
You guys are very secret agents of course.
They should already be in your position.

514
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,656
Send the data to me the mission.

515
00:45:28,135 --> 00:45:30,738
Come on, fellows.
Get out of the car!

516
00:45:35,848 --> 00:45:41,759
Droid, it looks like some sort of
Wheeler vehicles, with one ...

517
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:45,348
Two passengers ...

518
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:48,231
They were armed and I want them dead.

519
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:51,834
Droid!

520
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,467
Loss! Loss!

521
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:13,367
Unidentified, Max da Costa.
Federal prisoner number 6149C-557-A ...

522
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:24,427
Jam!

523
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:26,443
It is!

524
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:31,221
She recharge.

525
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,261
All right! We have passed!
Come on! I protect you!

526
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:56,973
Come on, Come on. Come on!

527
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:09,976
Do not move.

528
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,145
Come on!

529
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:17,506
There's another one!

530
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:20,891
Die, you bastard!

531
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,694
Do not shoot the target!

532
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,438
No, No!
He's been shot!

533
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:27,382
People are traumatized heavy heart.
Blood pressure decreases.

534
00:48:27,562 --> 00:48:28,702
His head did not hit!

535
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,243
Just his chest!

536
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,988
That's good.
Hold his head.

537
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:36,270
I connect it.
Quick install.

538
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,627
Come on, come on!

539
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:41,502
Yes.
Successfully?

540
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,994
Yes, we synchronize.

541
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:47,233
You do not know what you're doing.

542
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,845
One minute to the target, sir.

543
00:48:54,939 --> 00:48:58,033
Well, we just went through.
I'm going to move now.

544
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:03,062
It works.

545
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,946
It is a database, ma'am.
They are men download now.

546
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,026
My friends, we have guests.

547
00:49:13,878 --> 00:49:15,467
I'm dead!

548
00:49:16,938 --> 00:49:18,488
Come on, fellows. Hurry.

549
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:20,647
That's Raven.
It's the military.

550
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:24,151
Well, it's 97. ... We ride 98
Hurry up, they come.

551
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:26,078
Just a little more! Little longer!
99!

552
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,267
This is it!

553
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:33,925
Damn The data must be broken!

554
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,011
What is that, what does it mean?

555
00:49:36,646 --> 00:49:40,246
I can not read the data.
Scrambled! I can not read the data.

556
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:41,470
What?

557
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:46,094
Come on, man! We have to go!
What do you mean encrypted?

558
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,364
Fuck you!

559
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:50,257
No, no! Try again! Let's try again!

560
00:49:50,384 --> 00:49:54,985
Let me go I go.
Please. Please try again.

561
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:57,815
Fuck you!
Let's get out of here.

562
00:49:58,194 --> 00:50:00,383
What are you doing, Sandro?

563
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,304
Let's get out of here!
Asshole!

564
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:15,535
Come on, Max!

565
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:18,315
Get out of there!
Come on!

566
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:20,912
We have to go!
Come on, Max! Come on!

567
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:25,882
Hey, boss. Someone ran.

568
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:52,884
That's what I mean!

569
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:54,196
Asshole!

570
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,738
Target is moving south.
To the southwest.

571
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,913
Come on, Max!
They're coming!

572
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:05,510
There's another one.

573
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:08,153
All right!

574
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:11,116
This is wrong!'s All wrong!

575
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:03,986
Use the weapon, sir.

576
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,914
You think you could go anywhere?

577
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,753
Asshole!

578
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:42,292
Son of a bitch!

579
00:52:46,783 --> 00:52:47,987
No!

580
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:29,448
No, no!

581
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,654
No!
Wake up!

582
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,517
Get up!

583
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:51,924
No!

584
00:54:10,988 --> 00:54:14,201
One person survived and escaped, ma'am.

585
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:18,421
They get the data.
Repeat. They get the data.

586
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:22,801
As soon catch the target.
Do not destroy the brain.

587
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,981
Come on! There were vague, comrade!

588
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,244
People have lost a lot of blood
That cause heart attacks.

589
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:38,400
Time of death, 17:45.

590
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:24,808
Come on, where are you hiding?

591
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:26,882
What's that?

592
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,128
It looks like a set of hog, boss.

593
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,665
Fuck! Find him!

594
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,426
Let's go back to the crash site!
Check out what they left behind.

595
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:45,620
Understood.

596
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:00,839
Thank you.

597
00:56:22,597 --> 00:56:26,351
Boss, I think you should see this.

598
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,753
This is data that is transferred
Between Carlyle and criminals.

599
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:35,665
So that's why he wants it.

600
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,952
There are key to the kingdom in his head.

601
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:41,867
Now you have to find it.

602
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,787
Launching a spy plane.

603
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:58,134
Network 13, 3 to 11.

604
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,897
I ordered a full sealing.

605
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,935
Give the order no-fly
To Los Angeles.

606
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:08,224
The whole L.A?
The killer is still out there.

607
00:57:08,245 --> 00:57:11,844
Until we catch him,
No one should leave the city.

608
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:19,578
Signal disturbed.

609
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,237
What the hell ...?

610
00:57:25,878 --> 00:57:27,253
Max.

611
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:12,445
Hey, baby.
Hey.

612
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:14,244
We can go home.

613
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,332
Am I better?

614
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:21,945
I'll take the car, okay?

615
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:26,223
I'll be right back.

616
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,665
Frey ...

617
00:58:35,247 --> 00:58:37,370
Max!

618
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,823
Jeez, what happened to you?

619
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,658
Damn, I'm going to call the doctor.
No, No!

620
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:49,939
I can not go in there.
Max!

621
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:52,112
I can not get there ...
Max, listen, you need a doctor, okay?

622
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:54,668
They're looking for me.
They will kill me.

623
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:56,290
I'm here to find you.
Max!

624
00:58:56,373 --> 00:58:59,346
I need your help.
You have to pass through the system to be able to care.

625
00:58:59,479 --> 00:59:03,133
Help me.
I do not want to die.

626
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,478
Max, Max!

627
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,425
Stay conscious!

628
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:25,943
I want to see him.
Mama will help her, okay?

629
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:27,354
Try to sleep.

630
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,451
Do not sleep!

631
00:59:37,706 --> 00:59:38,902
Come on!

632
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,327
Max, you can do it, come on!

633
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:46,612
No, turn around!

634
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:36,391
Max, Max, wait.

635
01:00:39,947 --> 01:00:42,744
Thank you.
Who did this to you?

636
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:45,309
Do not know.
I was injured at work.

637
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:50,900
I can work, from the Spider so
I could go up there and be healed.

638
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:54,430
Everything is so chaotic,
And now I'm in trouble.

639
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:55,967
Mom?

640
01:00:58,816 --> 01:01:01,898
Hey, honey, come here!

641
01:01:05,509 --> 01:01:07,384
Who is this guy?

642
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:12,526
His name is Max. Mothers know
When he was your age.

643
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:16,415
It's Mathilda.
Hi.

644
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,962
Go watch cartoons, okay?

645
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:21,254
I'll be right there.

646
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:28,393
I do not know you ...
Sorry, I must go.

647
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:31,941
Wait, Max, you can not go.
I should not have come here. I have to go!

648
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:36,086
Max! Him dying.
He was suffering from end-stage leukemia.

649
01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:40,964
I told you my life complicated.
I need you to help me.

650
01:01:41,255 --> 01:01:44,328
I do not know how to do this ...
Did what?

651
01:01:44,464 --> 01:01:47,474
Brought to Elysium.
I can not help him.

652
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,412
I'll do it if I could.

653
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:54,258
How about this? Fake ID.
If you take us there,

654
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:57,472
What he can be cured with this?
That's not how it works.

655
01:01:57,598 --> 01:02:00,810
It's coded for me,
And connected with my DNA.

656
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:04,639
People are looking for this, they ...
You do not understand who these people are.

657
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,811
If they find me here,
They will kill us all.

658
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:11,215
The only way I can
Help is gone., I promise.

659
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,363
He's all I have.
I'm sorry.

660
01:02:20,518 --> 01:02:22,846
You bandaged.

661
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,553
Yes. Bandaged me.

662
01:02:30,688 --> 01:02:32,096
What are you doing?

663
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:36,323
I do not want you hurt.
Want to hear a story?

664
01:02:36,411 --> 01:02:37,978
No, ah ...

665
01:02:38,649 --> 01:02:42,102
There's a meerkat who live in the forest.

666
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,067
He was hungry and his size.

667
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:46,739
Very little.

668
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:52,815
And the only large animals that could eat,
Because they can reach the fruit-buahannya.

669
01:02:53,076 --> 01:02:56,164
So he's friends with a hippo ...

670
01:02:56,316 --> 01:02:57,816
Okay, stop.

671
01:02:59,883 --> 01:03:01,882
It will not end well for the meerkat.

672
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:07,700
Yes, because he was standing in the back of a hippopotamus.

673
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:10,988
To take all the fruit he wants.

674
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,133
What's in it for the hippo?
The hippopotamus needed a friend.

675
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,072
I'm sorry.

676
01:03:56,188 --> 01:03:58,663
Possible targets.

677
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:14,221
Hey, boss.

678
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,250
We found him.

679
01:04:24,144 --> 01:04:25,817
Landed the plane!

680
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:54,152
Mom, what's all okay?
All fine, dear.

681
01:05:03,994 --> 01:05:05,683
Safe.

682
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:09,880
It's okay, sweetheart.

683
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,653
Good afternoon.

684
01:05:12,467 --> 01:05:18,197
I'm sorry we came suddenly to the house,
Did not mean to scare your little princess.

685
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:23,038
I and my friends this,
Looking for a man ...

686
01:05:23,155 --> 01:05:25,870
That was probably here.

687
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:28,834
I wish you could tell us
Where he was hiding.

688
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:30,293
Not.

689
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,676
I ...

690
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,773
I do not know where he is.
I do not believe it.

691
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:41,643
I hate violence
In front of the kids ...

692
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,274
So I want you to close your eyes, dear.

693
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:49,402
All fine, honey.
I want you to tell me.

694
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:53,256
It is remembered now?
Mama ...

695
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:56,419
Close your eyes, keep your eyes closed.
Close your eyes.

696
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,250
Please, I do not know where he is.

697
01:05:58,426 --> 01:06:01,331
He's hurt, I help him and he's gone.

698
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:03,403
Help!

699
01:06:03,404 --> 01:06:06,623
You know, people say now
Loyalty is hard to find.

700
01:06:11,204 --> 01:06:13,119
What is this?

701
01:06:13,825 --> 01:06:17,089
What do you build a hospital here?
He's sick.

702
01:06:17,123 --> 01:06:21,351
He's sick? Let me see it.
It's nothing.

703
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:25,455
Do not touch him.
Did you see it? Instinct to protect.

704
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,810
I said do not touch him!
I just want to see your son.

705
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:29,828
Do not touch him!

706
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:32,797
Bring him. Come on!
Where are you taking him?

707
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,348
Unfortunately, all is fine.

708
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,859
All fine, honey.
Everything is fine.

709
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,933
Sit! Shut up!

710
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:54,576
Stop!

711
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:02,674
No, no, do not shoot him!
Lower the gun! Leave her alone!

712
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:06,420
You've got something, right?
What?

713
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:09,476
That's why they shut down
The whole sky, Come on, what's up?

714
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,191
Remittances, corporate data,
There must be something important in there!

715
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:14,241
Nothing. I did not get anything!

716
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:18,739
Everything is encrypted. Julio dead,
You owe me. Let's go now!

717
01:07:18,823 --> 01:07:22,303
You can not be blocked flight system!

718
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:24,525
Nobody can go up there.

719
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:29,686
Until when?
Until I do not know.

720
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:34,096
I have to go there, I had to go up there.
All people want to go up there.

721
01:07:34,223 --> 01:07:35,198
My people are working on it.

722
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,717
I'm thinking maybe the system
Can never be online again.

723
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:42,173
But, for now ...

724
01:07:42,723 --> 01:07:46,833
Let us see what you have in mind.
Do not touch me!

725
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:54,790
Look at me, if they shut up the heavens,
For what's in your head ...

726
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:59,662
Perhaps the key to open it
Is also in there, is not it?

727
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,875
Come on.

728
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,653
Well ...

729
01:08:17,835 --> 01:08:22,041
They'll hunt up
To the end of the world for this.

730
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:23,387
What's that?

731
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:26,324
It is a program reboot
Revive) for Elysium.

732
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:30,937
Anyone who has this, would have the power
To take over their entire system.

733
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,876
Opening the border ...

734
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:38,829
Making everyone so residents Elysium.

735
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:44,316
This could save your life.

736
01:08:45,805 --> 01:08:49,617
We can save everyone.
When can I go?

737
01:08:49,743 --> 01:08:52,315
They are trying to hijack the signal
Are blocked, but soon ...

738
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:55,685
Bullshit, when can we go?
I do not know.

739
01:08:55,976 --> 01:08:56,756
Five days.

740
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:00,018
Fuck you, I do not have 5 days.
I only have a few hours ...

741
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:01,641
My people are working on it.

742
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,956
You always do,
You can not take me there.

743
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,356
I do not know why you continue to send people
Up there, they'll just fired.

744
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,353
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I mean!

745
01:09:11,477 --> 01:09:14,715
We will control the system.
We can lead.

746
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:18,835
We can change history!
Wait a minute ...

747
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:22,815
What's in the head,
It means a lot to them, right?

748
01:09:24,714 --> 01:09:30,149
Do not do this. If it falls into the hands
Wrong, they will kill us all.

749
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,196
Listen.
I'm going up there now.

750
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:37,608
If you find me, and I'm healed,
Then you can have all of this.

751
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:41,420
But I'm not going to die.
This is wrong, Max, do not do this.

752
01:09:52,099 --> 01:09:54,573
Do not shoot him! Do not shoot him!
Do not shoot him!

753
01:09:54,698 --> 01:09:56,104
Do not shoot him!

754
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,720
It's nothing.
Everything is fine.

755
01:10:07,734 --> 01:10:09,890
I always wanted to have a wife.

756
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:19,087
Never get married, you know?
Too much temptation.

757
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:24,241
But you ...

758
01:10:29,536 --> 01:10:34,320
You made me ready to get married.
You made me ready to get married, darling.

759
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,683
Damn, sir.
Eh?

760
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:50,039
You'd better see this.

761
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:53,318
What? There's what?
Look at these fools.

762
01:10:56,865 --> 01:10:58,254
Bring us back.

763
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:24,829
Drakey?
Yes, sir.

764
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:26,192
Open the door.

765
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:42,507
Stop right there and do everything I say.

766
01:11:42,682 --> 01:11:46,247
Or I'll blow my head, understand?

767
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:47,835
Yes.

768
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:51,068
You can get everything in my head!

769
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,447
Just take me up there,
And take me to the medical capsule.

770
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:58,698
What I have is very valuable.
We can treat you.

771
01:11:59,374 --> 01:12:02,577
Memasukanmu to medical capsule,
Something like that.

772
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:06,198
Let's go!
We will take you up there.

773
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:11,559
The air up there nice and clean.
Try it you'll like it.

774
01:12:12,983 --> 01:12:15,930
Do not you dare!
Let's ride!

775
01:12:16,306 --> 01:12:19,127
Come meet my friends, come on!

776
01:12:19,884 --> 01:12:21,475
Do not be shy, I do not bite.

777
01:12:21,724 --> 01:12:25,211
Introducing, the Drakey.
This is Max.

778
01:12:25,362 --> 01:12:26,501
How are you?

779
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:39,279
Let's go!

780
01:12:41,526 --> 01:12:45,055
Yes, ma'am, we've found the subject.

781
01:12:46,173 --> 01:12:50,683
Open sky, we'll be there.
Will be waiting for you in 19 minutes.

782
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:07,653
Cancel fly.
Well, ma'am.

783
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:13,119
What's that?

784
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:17,289
What is it? We are connected again?
Marcelo What's happening? We're back?

785
01:13:17,413 --> 01:13:19,091
We're back online, Spider.

786
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:32,256
Frey ...

787
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:36,328
I'm sorry ... I will
Fix everything.

788
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,878
We get it.
Okay. Where is he?

789
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:54,632
He left the Earth ...
He's heading Elysium.

790
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:04,702
Manuel! Rico! Prepare the weapon!
We're up.

791
01:14:11,163 --> 01:14:14,694
Echo Leader 234, ask for permission
Land in sector 22.

792
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:18,405
Understandably Echo Leader 234.
You're allowed to enter.

793
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:19,266
I see you holding the G-1 there.
Hey, back off! Back off!

794
01:15:19,491 --> 01:15:21,053
Or what?
I'll take it off.

795
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:22,413
Will you do it? Huh?

796
01:15:22,504 --> 01:15:24,410
I want to have in your head.

797
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,905
Catch her!

798
01:15:46,857 --> 01:15:48,166
Look out!

799
01:16:28,476 --> 01:16:29,720
What should we do, ma'am?

800
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,993
I want all the people who came out of
The plane was captured by Homeland Security.

801
01:16:34,195 --> 01:16:37,835
Evacuate everyone from level five
Out of the building, now.

802
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:47,996
I remind you about this.

803
01:16:48,096 --> 01:16:51,843
The plane was registered just fell
Thorus and potentially harmful.

804
01:16:51,893 --> 01:16:55,904
All because of your incompetence to act.
Evacuation him.

805
01:16:56,537 --> 01:16:59,984
Put your hands on me.
It is a war situation.

806
01:17:00,104 --> 01:17:03,290
It makes CCB is under my control.

807
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,780
Now, if you'll let me do my job.

808
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:09,429
I'm sure there is a fund raising event
You have to attend.

809
01:17:09,475 --> 01:17:10,655
Come on, sir.

810
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:24,820
Max!

811
01:17:24,893 --> 01:17:26,926
Get me out of here, Max!

812
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,430
I tried!

813
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:32,781
Air quality is down to a toxic level.

814
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:40,476
Get me out of here!

815
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:44,154
It is recommended that out of the plane immediately.

816
01:17:55,549 --> 01:17:56,681
Run!

817
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:57,878
Asshole!

818
01:18:13,316 --> 01:18:16,228
Two illegal residents heading north,
East location falls.

819
01:18:24,509 --> 01:18:27,828
You killed two people,
I'll handle him.

820
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:31,685
Welcome to the spectacular property ...

821
01:18:44,602 --> 01:18:45,798
Error.

822
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,116
No!

823
01:18:47,349 --> 01:18:49,528
People go undetected.

824
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:55,344
He is sick, please help us, he's comatose.

825
01:18:55,392 --> 01:18:56,710
Help!

826
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:24,859
He's awake.
You can let go of this thing?

827
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:27,529
Can not.
He connected with the data.

828
01:19:27,646 --> 01:19:29,509
The data is bound to the nervous system.

829
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,471
The data are still intact, right?

830
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,146
The data seems to be intact.

831
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,147
If we take this data from it,
It will kill him.

832
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:39,442
It's nothing.

833
01:19:39,485 --> 01:19:42,931
How long until you can download it
And turn on the system?

834
01:19:42,993 --> 01:19:44,373
Not long, ma'am.

835
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:47,940
Keep everything remains confidential.
Lock all access.

836
01:19:48,023 --> 01:19:49,847
Preparing now.

837
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,031
Remove them both from here.

838
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:57,068
Received.

839
01:19:57,238 --> 01:19:59,980
Crowe, you want to bring the cheek boss?

840
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,330
Yes, be ready.

841
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,825
Warning.
One never registered aircraft approaching.

842
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,801
Bring him around in circles.

843
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,772
Make them busy.

844
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:35,405
Can.

845
01:20:35,786 --> 01:20:36,951
Come on!

846
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:40,258
All right. 50 Hexabit, comrade.
You ready?

847
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:43,357
What are you doing to him?

848
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,406
Hey, What are you doing to him?

849
01:20:46,734 --> 01:20:48,551
What will happen to him?
Hey!

850
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,502
Get up.

851
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:54,447
Wake up.
Max.

852
01:20:54,986 --> 01:20:57,819
Max. Max.
Max!

853
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:13,729
Get in there!

854
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:26,053
The boss is really messed up, eh?

855
01:21:26,127 --> 01:21:28,595
Hey, he's hit by a grenade.

856
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:35,159
She's fine.
But he will be very angry when they realized later.

857
01:21:35,231 --> 01:21:38,100
Remember when he lost his leg?

858
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,609
Reconstruction of the face.

859
01:22:02,504 --> 01:22:03,941
Kruger.

860
01:22:06,373 --> 01:22:07,786
Boss?

861
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:11,477
It Crowe.

862
01:22:14,228 --> 01:22:16,178
Where is he?

863
01:22:18,152 --> 01:22:21,277
All right, all ready.
Let's get the data.

864
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:28,228
Take the needle! Take the needle!
Take the needle now!

865
01:22:48,815 --> 01:22:51,440
Where they bring the girls?
Google.

866
01:22:51,545 --> 01:22:52,958
Where is it?

867
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:54,800
Third floor.

868
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:07,702
Poison deadly radiation is detected.
You need medical care right away.

869
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:18,449
You're an idiot!
You realize what you're doing?

870
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:23,683
You dropped the vehicle is not licensed
To the inhabited area.

871
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:28,786
Your orders are to keep
This all remains a secret.

872
01:23:28,902 --> 01:23:31,895
Do you remember what that means?

873
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:38,533
Are you crazy?
You're no use to me.

874
01:23:39,086 --> 01:23:41,997
The administration realized what we were doing.

875
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:44,241
They'll hang us for treason.

876
01:23:46,725 --> 01:23:49,746
For God's sake, Kruger!
Are you listening?

877
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:52,260
Yes.

878
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:56,023
Yes, ma'am.

879
01:23:56,655 --> 01:23:58,302
I'm listening.

880
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:05,100
Sorry, since we dropped the plane
And damaging the home page.

881
01:24:05,231 --> 01:24:08,309
But nobody will hang
We as treason.

882
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,717
It is we who will hang them.

883
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,557
Lift your head and hold your wound.

884
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:19,605
It's not too powerful now, eh?
Get ready, man.

885
01:24:19,978 --> 01:24:23,448
Elysium will soon have a decent president.

886
01:24:27,774 --> 01:24:29,908
She needs treatment.

887
01:24:36,302 --> 01:24:38,381
I was going to heal your daughter.

888
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:42,186
But now, I'll make sure he is
Would never heal.

889
01:24:43,168 --> 01:24:46,015
Drakey, Do not believe all politicians.

890
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:47,977
Killing them all!

891
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:49,388
Thank you, boss.

892
01:24:49,924 --> 01:24:51,905
I'll find you, little bastard.

893
01:24:52,056 --> 01:24:53,961
And I'll take what should be mine.

894
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:55,686
This place is mine now.

895
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:58,241
You want to come and play with me?

896
01:24:58,345 --> 01:24:59,633
Let's play.

897
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:11,499
Hey!

898
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:21,453
What the fuck is that?

899
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:25,545
All members of the CCB ...

900
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:37,691
Fast! Faster!
Come on! Come on!

901
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:41,275
Not.

902
01:25:42,008 --> 01:25:43,857
No thanks.

903
01:25:49,383 --> 01:25:51,495
People die.

904
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:15,217
Spider!

905
01:26:15,314 --> 01:26:16,911
You heard me, Spider?

906
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,568
Max, where are you?

907
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:22,124
The data I have is, can make
All become citizens of Elysium, right?

908
01:26:23,281 --> 01:26:24,283
Yes.

909
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,496
You know how to remove it, right?

910
01:26:26,553 --> 01:26:27,205
Yes.

911
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,512
Are you sure?

912
01:26:28,602 --> 01:26:29,935
Yes, I'm sure.

913
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:32,176
Okay, listen, and be careful.

914
01:26:39,687 --> 01:26:41,549
Armament selected.

915
01:26:55,402 --> 01:26:56,564
Ready.

916
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:01,800
Light.

917
01:27:08,106 --> 01:27:09,398
All right.

918
01:27:09,888 --> 01:27:12,554
Crowe, kill them both.

919
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:15,287
With pleasure, Boss.
With pleasure.

920
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:17,621
Where are you, an amateur?
Where are you?

921
01:27:36,069 --> 01:27:37,977
How is it, sweetie?

922
01:27:39,318 --> 01:27:40,730
Let's play.

923
01:27:40,942 --> 01:27:44,487
Come on, I'll slow down, promise.
No. Do not please.

924
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:46,143
Come on.
Let go of me.

925
01:27:46,223 --> 01:27:48,524
Are you ready? Come here.
No, please.

926
01:28:19,164 --> 01:28:20,925
Asshole!

927
01:28:59,573 --> 01:29:00,942
He's still alive?

928
01:29:01,038 --> 01:29:02,113
For now.

929
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:03,564
Stay behind me.

930
01:29:05,422 --> 01:29:07,214
I'll get you out of here.

931
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:09,010
I have a plan.

932
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:17,972
Did you hear that noise?
It's come to my voice!

933
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,734
I'll find you!
I'll be looking for you!

934
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:26,215
Well, Frey, we should split up.

935
01:29:26,286 --> 01:29:27,170
What?
Listen.

936
01:29:27,312 --> 01:29:30,257
You have to go upstairs,
Take this. Okay?

937
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,496
Find a home, find a medical capsule.

938
01:29:32,555 --> 01:29:33,942
Max, it's not going to work.
Do not stop. Do not stop ...

939
01:29:34,064 --> 01:29:36,379
He had no ID.
That's not going to work.

940
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:39,433
It would work this time.
I know how to fix it.

941
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,354
Surface is selected.
Go on.

942
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,633
Come with me.

943
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:44,592
I'm right behind you.
Not.

944
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:46,709
I promise.

945
01:30:04,753 --> 01:30:09,257
Okay, a mother and her child
Just walked into the elevator.

946
01:30:09,369 --> 01:30:11,703
They're up for a medical capsule.

947
01:30:11,769 --> 01:30:14,108
Ask one of your men to
Make sure they get there.

948
01:30:14,256 --> 01:30:15,415
And kutepati my promise.

949
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:20,063
Jump to a medical capsule.

950
01:30:20,691 --> 01:30:22,585
Come on.

951
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:29,265
Come on, come on.
This way.

952
01:30:29,595 --> 01:30:30,809
Come on.

953
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:33,784
Hurry up.

954
01:30:38,446 --> 01:30:39,949
Almost there.
Almost there.

955
01:30:47,068 --> 01:30:49,887
Go ahead!

956
01:30:59,067 --> 01:31:01,536
That's what I meant.

957
01:31:08,658 --> 01:31:10,918
To the door!
To the Door!

958
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,406
Fast! Faster!
Come on! Come on!

959
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:20,045
Come on, hurry.

960
01:31:22,987 --> 01:31:26,233
Damn door. Come on!
Come on, you go first, let's go!

961
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:28,536
Emergency Locking is done ...

962
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,060
Come on!

963
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,778
Come on! Stand up!

964
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:43,393
Stand up! Stand up!
Come on!

965
01:31:57,927 --> 01:31:59,926
You little bastard.

966
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:02,397
I will pluck your head.

967
01:32:02,472 --> 01:32:05,426
No!
You have to stand up now.

968
01:32:18,423 --> 01:32:19,843
No!

969
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,183
Stay there.

970
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:37,513
Asshole!

971
01:33:03,565 --> 01:33:06,419
Do you think it could be passed?
Come on, Max! Come on!

972
01:33:07,169 --> 01:33:09,513
I'm just warming up.

973
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:38,761
Come on.

974
01:33:39,975 --> 01:33:42,391
Get up now.
Stand up, come on!

975
01:33:42,467 --> 01:33:44,560
Come on, I'm hurt, huh?

976
01:33:45,637 --> 01:33:47,668
A little dizzy, huh?

977
01:33:50,265 --> 01:33:51,492
What I'm about you?

978
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,956
Or are you bleeding?
Look at that.

979
01:33:54,107 --> 01:33:55,406
I remind you.

980
01:34:08,623 --> 01:34:10,761
You want to heal that little girl?

981
01:34:10,861 --> 01:34:13,028
You just have to go through.

982
01:34:27,235 --> 01:34:29,650
What was that, basic sissy?

983
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:49,845
You have to die.

984
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:52,314
We die together, kid.

985
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:08,848
Come on, let's go.

986
01:35:16,549 --> 01:35:18,777
Come on, man, let's do it.
Come on!

987
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,008
Ready? Come on.

988
01:35:33,368 --> 01:35:35,169
Call the guards, now!

989
01:35:40,655 --> 01:35:41,826
Come on.

990
01:35:43,098 --> 01:35:44,358
All right.

991
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:46,255
Let's do it.

992
01:36:05,245 --> 01:36:06,265
Sorry.

993
01:36:06,785 --> 01:36:08,857
The population of the Earth: ILLEGAL.

994
01:36:09,254 --> 01:36:10,744
The population of the Earth: LEGAL.

995
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:13,418
Okay, we are ready, we are ready.

996
01:36:13,573 --> 01:36:14,604
We're ready.

997
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,242
What?

998
01:36:16,349 --> 01:36:18,601
Downloading the data would cause
Death to the data carrier.

999
01:36:20,184 --> 01:36:21,373
Max.

1000
01:36:21,547 --> 01:36:23,469
It's nothing.
I know.

1001
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:27,207
There's no way back from here.

1002
01:36:27,663 --> 01:36:29,861
There is no medical capsules can cure you.

1003
01:36:43,591 --> 01:36:45,441
All right, give it to me.

1004
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,556
Take it.

1005
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:52,238
Ready?

1006
01:36:52,299 --> 01:36:55,303
You just have to push that button.

1007
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:00,255
Frey?

1008
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,681
Max?
Max where are you?

1009
01:37:05,135 --> 01:37:07,092
I have to break my promise.

1010
01:37:07,246 --> 01:37:09,407
I can not go up there.

1011
01:37:11,298 --> 01:37:13,425
Remember what I said when we were young?

1012
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,636
Yes.

1013
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:17,117
One day I'll get us there.

1014
01:37:17,259 --> 01:37:19,912
Really?
Yes, I promise.

1015
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:32,557
You will not believe what
I see now.

1016
01:37:39,905 --> 01:37:42,841
And tell Mathilda I love the story.

1017
01:37:42,971 --> 01:37:44,230
Really.

1018
01:37:46,973 --> 01:37:49,807
I understand why the Hippo
Want to do.

1019
01:38:17,081 --> 01:38:18,242
Come on!

1020
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:21,711
You go first. Come on!

1021
01:38:21,889 --> 01:38:24,814
Every person has the privilege, Max.

1022
01:38:25,286 --> 01:38:27,659
Something that was destined for him.

1023
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,719
What he got when he was born.

1024
01:38:32,632 --> 01:38:35,511
Restarting the system &gt;&gt;&gt; 5, 4, ...

1025
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,236
Stop her!

1026
01:38:37,326 --> 01:38:38,866
Fuck you!

1027
01:38:46,744 --> 01:38:48,394
Let go of me!

1028
01:38:50,521 --> 01:38:51,897
Core renewed.

1029
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:02,083
Residents Added new &gt;&gt;&gt;

1030
01:39:02,247 --> 01:39:04,162
Come on, please.

1031
01:39:04,871 --> 01:39:06,577
Residents

1033

Back off, Officer.

1034
01:39:49,228 --> 01:39:50,650
Hold him!

1035
01:39:50,766 --> 01:39:53,589
I can not help citizens Elysium.

1036
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:55,912
What?

1037
01:39:56,692 --> 01:39:58,027
Good work.

1038
01:39:59,155 --> 01:40:01,634
Guess Whose Elysium now.

1039
01:40:01,986 --> 01:40:04,802
New residents who need medical care.

1040
01:40:04,857 --> 01:40:06,873
Calculating ...

1041
01:40:07,074 --> 01:40:09,775
Launch of medical aid to the Earth plane.

1042
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:59,810
You see how beautiful Elysium of here?

1043
01:41:00,344 --> 01:41:03,401
Now look how beautiful
We look from up there.

1044
01:41:03,773 --> 01:41:05,686
Now it's yours.

1045
01:41:06,202 --> 01:41:09,655
So you'll never forget where you come from.

1046
